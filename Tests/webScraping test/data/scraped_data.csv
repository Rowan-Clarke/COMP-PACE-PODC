https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/your-childs-hearing/hearing-loss/describing-hearing-loss/,Describing Hearing Loss,"The following questions help to identify the different types of hearing loss:When did the hearing loss occur (from birth or after)? What type of hearing loss is it (permanent or conductive)? How severe is the hearing loss? Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies? Is there a hearing loss in both ears? Is the hearing loss the same in both ears? Is the hearing loss stable over time (has the audiogram changed)? When did the hearing loss occur?Any hearing loss that is present at birth or soon after is referred to as congenital. Hearing loss which occurs later in life is referred to as acquired.The earlier a hearing loss occurs, the more significant its impact will be. Children who are born with a hearing loss have limited access to the sounds around them (including speech) from the very beginning.Hearing loss that occurs before a child develops speech and language skills is referred to as prelingual. Hearing loss that occurs after a child develops speech and language skills is known as postlingual.The effects of a prelingual hearing loss are usually much more significant than a postlingual hearing loss. The challenge faced by a young child with a prelingual hearing loss is to develop normal spoken language skills. The challenge faced by a child with a postlingual hearing loss is to learn to manage their hearing loss in order to minimise its impact on their daily life.What type of hearing loss is it?When a hearing loss occurs because the sound cannot travel freely down the outer ear and through the middle ear, it is referred to as a conductive hearing loss. A child with a middle ear infection may have a conductive hearing loss. If the conductive hearing loss is a result of illness or infection, then it is not permanent.Hearing loss which is caused by the sound not being converted into electrical signals within the inner ear, or not being transmitted along the auditory nerve to the brain is referred to as sensorineural hearing loss. This hearing loss is permanent.Some children experience both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, and this is referred to as a mixed hearing loss.How severe is the hearing loss?When hearing loss is measured, it will be described as mild, moderate, severe, profound or a combination of these. For example, if someone has a moderate hearing loss in the low frequencies and a profound hearing loss in the high frequencies, this hearing loss would be described as moderate to profound.Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies?When a hearing loss is plotted on an audiogram, it may appear flat, i.e. the hearing loss is much the same across the frequencies (seen on the diagram below), or it may be sloping, e.g. the hearing loss is much more severe in the higher frequencies than it is in the lower frequencies.Flat hearing losses are usually much easier to fit with a hearing aid. Sloping hearing losses may mean that children will miss a lot of the high frequency sounds such as ‘s’ and ‘sh’ and they are often more difficult to fit with a hearing aid.Is there a hearing loss in both ears?When there is a hearing loss in both ears, this is referred to as bilateral hearing loss. If hearing is normal in one ear, but there is a hearing loss in the other ear, this is referred to as unilateral hearing loss.Children with a unilateral hearing loss may have difficulty hearing well in noisy conditions and may have difficulty locating where sound is coming from. Teachers should make sure that children with a unilateral hearing loss always sit with their ‘good ear’ closer to the speaker.Is the hearing loss the same in both ears?When the hearing loss is very similar in both ears, this is referred to as a symmetrical loss. If the hearing loss is different in each ear, this is referred to as an asymmetrical loss. If the loss is very different in each ear, the child may experience difficulties similar to those associated with unilateral loss. Sometimes only the ‘better ear’ will be fitted with a hearing aid.Is the hearing loss stable over time?Hearing loss does not always remain the same over time. Some hearing losses, particularly conductive, may go up and down frequently. This is referred to as a fluctuating hearing loss.Children with fluctuating conductive hearing loss may develop very poor listening skills. Some hearing losses may get worse over time. This is referred to as a deteriorating hearing loss. Children with a deteriorating hearing loss may show a decline in their speech and listening skills over time.back to topFor more information:Describing the severity of the hearing lossUnilateral hearing loss"

They may also have difficulty hearing normal conversation in situations where there is a lot of background noise.To experience a mild hearing loss, try wearing earplugs or blocking your ears with your fingers. You can still hear people talking but it sounds muffled. It is even more difficult to understand the conversation if there is any background noise.Many children with mild hearing loss do not wear hearing aids. As the loss gets closer to 40dB some children may be fitted with a hearing aid.How will this impact on learning? A child with a mild hearing loss will not usually have difficulties related to their hearing loss in school unless they are in very noisy environments.For more informationBabies with a possible mild hearing lossYour baby has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step?Your child has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step?Management of a child with a permanent unaided hearing lossModerate Hearing Loss (41-70dB)A child with a moderate hearing loss will need to wear hearing aids to understand normal speech. Without hearing aids, the child will need to rely on speech reading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time.Hearing aids make all sounds louder for the child, including background noise.

They would not detect normal conversation without their hearing aid but may hear loud voices at close distances (up to one metre).It is important to remember that hearing aids make sounds louder for the child which assists with comprehension but they do not restore normal hearing. Even with hearing aids, a child with a severe hearing loss will need to rely on speechreading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time.Children with a severe hearing loss may be fitted with a cochlear implant.

The majority of children with a profound hearing loss have cochlear implants.Children with a profound hearing loss exhibit a wide range of communication skills. Some children develop listening and spoken language as their main means of communication. Other students may need, or prefer, to rely on manual communication skills such as signing.How will this impact on learning?A child with a profound hearing loss may:not hear important elements of the class discussion including key context and content without visual cueshave a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peersnot hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writinghave problems pronouncing some speech sounds, particularly those in the high frequency such as ‘s’ or ‘p’become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environmentsmisinterpret what is saidhave difficulty with some reading materialshave a limited understanding of colloquial language, such as ‘pull up your socks’have difficulty understanding complex sentencesuse a limited range of sentence structures and therefore use the same sentence structure repetitively (e.g. subject, verb, object)have trouble explaining their ideas to other peoplehave limited background knowledge and experiences in a range of areas which can affect learning and social skillshave poor vocal qualityrely on signed communication.back to top"
https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/your-childs-hearing/hearing-aids/what-do-hearing-aids-do/,What do hearing aids do?,"It is a common belief that people with hearing loss just can’t hear sounds loudly enough, but the problem is much more complicated than that.Four main problems caused by hearing lossHow do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss?Four main problems caused by hearing lossPeople with a hearing loss don’t hear soft sounds. Consequently, the softer speech sounds, which are usually the consonants, may simply not be heard. For example, the sequence of vowel sounds “i-e-a-ar” may have belonged to “pick the black harp” but could be heard by a hearing-impaired person as “kick the cat hard”. To overcome this difficulty, a hearing aid has to provide amplification to make these soft sounds loud enough to be heard.Key parts of particular speech sounds, such as the high frequency parts, might not be audible. To overcome this problem a hearing aid has to provide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and where speech has the weakest sounds.A hearing-impaired ear has difficulty separating sounds. When we are listening to a sound in noise, such as a person speaking at a party, the normal ear will send a message to the brain that two separate bundles of sound are coming through. The brain, by using other information available, such as context and direction of the sound, may then be able to ignore the unwanted noise and make good use of the speech. The impaired ear however is much less efficient at this task. Also, once speech and noise get mixed together inside a hearing aid, there is no way the hearing aid can separate the two to compensate. Directional microphones can help prevent the sound and noise from getting mixed together before they are passed to the amplifier.In a normal ear, a wide range of environmental sounds can fit between the softest sound that can be heard and the loudest sound that can be comfortably tolerated. In a hearing-impaired ear this ‘dynamic’ range is greatly reduced; ie. soft sound becomes inaudible and loud sound becomes uncomfortable and sometimes painfully loud. If a hearing aid makes all sounds louder so that the hearing-impaired person can hear the softest sounds then most of the loud sounds may be far too loud. So a hearing aid must give more amplification to a soft sound than it does to a louder sound. This squashing of sounds into the reduced range of an impaired ear is called “compression”.So a hearing aid has a big task. It must:Make sounds louder but not make loud sounds uncomfortably loudProvide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and speech sounds are the weakestTry to keep unwanted sounds, such a background noise, out of the signal provided to the wearerback to topHow do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss?Hearing aids amplify sounds so they are loud enough to be heard. A hearing aid also amplifies some frequencies more than others to allow for the characteristics of hearing loss and speech. The audiologist will set the hearing aid to make sure its output never exceeds a predetermined upper limit, so that sounds do not become uncomfortably loud.Peak Clipping Versus CompressionThe hearing aid limits loud sounds by either clipping off the peaks of the sounds (peak clipping) or by squashing or compressing them into a softer signal (compression).Both result in some distortion and loss of detail, but the distortion is less noticeable for compression than for peak clipping. In general, compression provides a clearer signal for speech in quiet, better listening situations, comfort for loud sounds, and less need for volume control adjustment.Research has shown that most people with hearing loss, except some of those with profound hearing losses, prefer compression output limiting. This is why Hearing Australia has had compression as a feature in its hearing aids since 1986.There are many new types of hearing aids now becoming available that use complex forms of compression, all with the aim of maximizing clarity and filling the impaired dynamic range with audible and comfortable sound. Hearing Australia’s standard hearing aids have many independently adjusted compressors which interact to provide controlled and comfortable loudness. This means that compression can be set to suit the individual needs of each child.back to topRelated articles:How do audiologists select hearing aids?Looking after hearing aids"

2 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024MAINTAINING GOOD EAR HEALTH
Your baby can hear with one ear—an important asset to protect. However, three 
key factors might affect their hearing during their life.
Ear wax
The ear naturally produces wax (or cerumen) to protect the ear canal. Typically, 
the ears clean themselves. The wax and dirt move away from the eardrum to the 
opening of the ear canal, where you can remove the wax with a damp cloth. 
However, sometimes wax builds up and blocks sound from reaching the 
eardrum. This can make it harder for your child with UHL to hear well. A wax 
build-up in young children is usually only noticed during routine ear 
examinations at the doctor or audiologist.
Ear drops that soften the wax are available from the pharmacy, which may be all 
that is needed to remove the wax. Always consult your family doctor (GP) if 
you’re concerned. 
Do not insert any foreign objects into the ear canal!
Avoid using ear candling which is both ineffective 
and dangerous.
Ear infections
Ear infections are common in young children and can cause temporary hearing 
loss and impact on speech development and learning.
Ear infections can occur in the outer ear (otitis externa) or the middle ear (otitis 
media). Outer ear infections are usually painful and may cause fever. In contrast, 
middle ear infections can lead to fluid build-up behind the eardrum, affecting the 
child's hearing.  
Otitis media with effusion or 'glue ear' occurs when fluid remains trapped behind 
the eardrum. A child with glue ear may have no symptoms, but the doctor can 
see the fluid during an ear examination. If the fluid remains in the middle ear for 
a long time or returns frequently, it can affect hearing.

Preventing ear infections
You can reduce your child's risk of ear infections.
• Immunise against pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal infections are a  
 major cause of otitis media. Vaccination for pneumococcal disease is part  
 of the routine immunisation schedule for babies at 2, 4 and 12 months old  
 (3 doses total) and is free for all Australian children.
• Practice good hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the germs that cause  
 colds and flu.
• Avoid exposing your child to cigarette smoke, as it increases the risk of ear  
 infections15.
Treating ear infections
Mild infections can often be managed with pain relievers like paracetamol. 
However, consult your family doctor if your child has a high fever, severe earache, 
or persistent ear discharge.
If you are worried about your child's hearing, arrange an appointment with your 
family doctor. Your doctor will examine your child's ears and should be able to 
tell if glue ear is present. If there is any pain or sign of infection, your GP may 
prescribe antibiotics. Your GP may want to wait to see if the glue ear clears up by 
itself before referring your child to an ENT specialist. 
4 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Noise
Noise-induced hearing loss is becoming more common, especially due to loud 
leisure activities. It's important to understand that the effect of noise on hearing 
is cumulative - factors like frequency of exposure, duration, and intensity can 
cause damage over time. 
Protecting you and your child from noise
Lead by example! Children learn from observing their parents, so you should 
always use safe listening practices. 
• Educate your child from the early years on the importance of ear   
 protection.
• Always wear hearing protectors when carrying out noisy tasks at home and  
 help to develop good habits in your children from a young age.
• Turn down the volume when listening to music in a confined space.
• Turn down the volume on personal stereo headsets. Smartphones let you  
 set a safe listening limit in settings. The volume of a personal headsets  
 should be at a level where you can still hear someone speaking to you an  
 arm's length away. 
• Using noise-cancelling headphones can help eliminate external   
 background noise and allow the MP3 player to be played at lower volume.
Sound Waves | 5ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN 
WITH UNILATERAL HEARING LOSS TO 
HEAR MORE EFFECTIVELY
Children with UHL often develop and use various adaptive strategies to enhance 
their hearing and communication abilities. These strategies help them cope with 
the challenges of having reduced hearing in one ear and make the most of their 
available hearing. You can support your child with UHL to develop these 
adaptive strategies from the outset through modelling the behaviours when 
interacting with your child.
Optimal seating and positioning
Car trips: Placing your child’s car seat so their affected ear is alongside the 
window will help them hear the other people in the car with their good ear.
Social interactions: When interacting with peers or in group settings, 
children can place themselves so their good ear is closest to the person 
speaking.
Dinner time: Sitting with their good ear towards the other people at the 
dinner table can help your child enjoy family conversations during meals.
Classroom seating:  Sitting in the front of the classroom and positioning 
their good ear towards the teacher can help your child with UHL hear instructions 
more clearly.
Visual cues and lip reading
Face the speaker: Encouraging others to face your child while speaking to 
them allows them to use visual cues and lip-reading for better understanding of 
speech.
Clear line of sight:  Being able to clearly see the speaker helps your child 
pick up other visual information that adds to what they hear and improves 
understanding.
6 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Environmental modifications
Reduce background noise: Minimising background noise at home and in 
school settings, such as turning off unnecessary electronic devices, can improve 
their ability to focus on important sounds.
Acoustic treatments: Using carpets, curtains, and soft furnishings can 
reduce echo and reverberation, making speech easier to hear and understand.
Communication Strategies
Clarification Requests : Teaching your child to ask for repetition or 
clarification if they miss something can help ensure they understand the 
conversation.
By employing these adaptive strategies, you can assist your child with UHL and 
their ability to hear and understand spoken language. These strategies not only 
enhance their communication skills but also support their academic and social 
development.
Sound Waves | 7CREATING A LANGUAGE-RICH HOME 
ENVIRONMENT
Children learn best through everyday activities and interactions within their 
natural environments. By weaving language into daily routines like playtime, 
mealtime, and family outings, families can support their child's speech and 
language development. In a language-rich environment, children are surrounded 
by words and conversations, giving them numerous opportunities to hear and 
use language. 
Families play a crucial role in creating a home environment that is rich in 
language experiences. By engaging in meaningful conversations with your child, 
reading to them daily, singing songs, and playing language-based games, you 
are providing a rich language environment. By describing daily activities, asking 
open-ended questions, and encouraging your child to express their thoughts 
and feelings, you can create a home environment that nurtures your child’s 
vocabulary growth, comprehension skills, and overall communication abilities. 
In today's digital age, it is important to limit children's screen time. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children under age 5 spend one 
hour or less on digital devices each day, and that those under age 1 should have 
no screen time at all. While certain digital tools can help the process of 
introducing children to new vocabulary, concepts, and stories, they shouldn’t 
take the place of direct human interaction, which is the most effective way for 
children to learn language.
8 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024CREATING A GOOD LISTENING 
ENVIRONMENT 
You already know how important it is to fill your child’s life with language. You 
want your child with UHL to hear all the songs you sing, the stories you share and 
the snippets of conversations that make up your family life. There are a few steps 
you can take to create an environment at home that will make it easier for your 
child to hear and listen.
The three main barriers to understanding speech for anyone with a hearing loss 
are: 
Distance from the sound 
Background noise 
Reverberation
Distance from the sound
Loudness, pitch, and distance from sound are all important in our ability to hear. 
Children with hearing loss have a reduced hearing range. Your child may have 
difficulty understanding what you are saying when you are talking from a 
distance.
Fortunately, we communicate with young babies at close range – they are usually 
only an arm’s length away as we cuddle, play and attend to their needs.
You do need to be aware of the impact of distance on your growing child’s 
listening ability. When you call from the next room for your child to put away the 
toys and they do not do it, they may not have heard your request. This is one of 
the dilemmas of being the parent of a child with hearing loss – have they not 
done it because they couldn’t hear you properly, or are they being disobedient?
Background noise
We all know the experience of trying to make out what someone is saying to us 
in a bar or a rock concert. We know the person is talking to us, and we can 
probably catch a few words and get the gist of the conversation. We probably 
know something about the topic and can use our knowledge and experience to 
understand what they are saying. And we are hearing with two ears.
Sound Waves | 9
Background noise is a problem for all children and anyone with hearing loss. 
Young children are unable to ‘predict from context.’ They have limited 
vocabulary and experience and can’t fill in the missing pieces of conversation as 
adults can. For children with typical hearing, their ability to understand sentences 
in noisy environments does improve through the early childhood years. They 
reach adult levels of speech understanding in noise in their teens. Children and 
adults with hearing loss will always find background noise challenging.
What can you do?
Homes with young children are noisy places. It is part of the fun of having 
children! But limiting background noise can make it much easier for your child 
with UHL to learn and understand what others are saying.
• Read to your child in a quiet environment and make sure their hearing ear  
 is closest to you.
• Turn off the TV/radio/music at mealtimes. Sit at the table together and  
 chat. Mealtimes provide excellent opportunities for language   
 development.
• Vacuum cleaners, washing machines and lawnmowers all make it very  
 difficult for your child to understand what you are saying to them. Be 
 aware of this if you give them instructions or warn them about something.
Families spend a lot of time in the car, and this can also be a difficult listening 
environment for children with UHL.
• Turn off the radio and wind up the windows if you are talking in the car, or  
 listening to music or a book. 
• Your child with UHL should be sitting with their affected ear alongside the  
 window for easier listening.
10 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Reverberation
Reverberation is the persistence of sound in a room after the original sound has 
stopped—like an echo. A room with ‘good acoustics’ is designed to reduce 
reverberation and make it easier to understand speech. Reverberation time 
depends mainly on the size of a room or space and the surface materials used. 
An empty bedroom with wooden floors has a longer reverberation time than a 
room with carpet, furniture and curtains.
What can you do at home?
Reverberation is usually more of a problem for children in the classroom than at 
home.
However, contemporary homes with open-plan living, timber floors and blinds 
on the windows are not easy listening environments for anyone with hearing loss. 
Soft furnishings that absorb sound reduce reverberation and make listening and 
understanding easier at home.
Carpets are better than hard floors, and curtains are better than bare windows or 
blinds.
Small things can make a difference in improving the 
listening environment for your child at home. Reducing 
noise and reverberation will help your child to listen and 
understand speech and participate fully in your family’s life. 
Sound Waves | 11LISTENING FATIGUE
Children with hearing loss exert more listening effort than their hearing peers 
when processing speech. Lip reading, interpreting expressions and filling in the 
gaps in conversations involve active concentration, often for extended periods, 
and this can cause significant fatigue. Children with UHL become more fatigued 
than normal hearing children, even when the affected ear is aided2. Fatigue can 
affect your child’s classroom performance, capacity to learn effectively, social 
relationships and their quality of life. 
Children with hearing loss have described feeling tired, drained, or exhausted 
after periods of concentrated listening. Increased listening effort can lead to 
cognitive fatigue, where the child is likely to have difficulty concentrating, 
become distractible and be less attentive. Cognitive fatigue, in turn, can lead to 
feelings of stress, tension and emotional difficulties.
The experience of listening-related fatigue in children with hearing loss varies 
widely. The amount of fatigue doesn’t directly correlate with the degree or type 
of hearing loss. There are currently no specific tests for measuring listening 
fatigue in children with hearing loss. Nevertheless, it’s important to recognise 
that children with hearing loss have an increased risk of fatigue at school. 
There are strategies for managing listening-related fatigue that can be 
implemented in the school setting.

12 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024SOUND LOCALISATION AND SAFETY
One of the difficulties people with unilateral hearing loss have is recognising 
where a sound is coming from. We need sound to reach both our ears to localise 
the sound. Our brain receives the sound signal from both ears and can accurately 
interpret where a sound is coming from.
With unilateral hearing loss, your child’s brain may only receive the signal from 
the better ear, and while your child will hear the sound, they won’t be able to tell 
where it is coming from. The greater the degree of hearing loss, the more difficult 
localising sound will become.
The most noticeable difficulty for families is when calling their children. Tell them 
exactly where you are, or they will struggle to find you.
Road safety
An inability to localise sound has a more critical impact - safety, particularly on 
the road. Your child may hear a car but not know its direction. Good road safety 
behaviour starts early. Children learn from watching their parents, and they copy 
their behaviour. Set a good example from the start:
• Cross the road at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings.
• Don’t cross the road between parked cars. Children cannot see an 
approaching vehicle, and the child with unilateral hearing loss may not hear 
the car or know which side the car is coming from.
• Car parks can also be hazardous for the same reason.
Generally, children under 10 need active adult supervision when crossing the 
road. They have difficulty judging how far away a car is and how fast it is going. 
Children also find it hard to identify if a place is safe to cross the road. Learning 
to cross the road safely takes time and practice. Walking with your child to the 
shops or school is an ideal time to teach road safety behaviour.
Sound Waves | 13
Stop - Look - Listen - Think
Teach you child to STOP – LOOK – LISTEN – THINK  when crossing the road. 
Model the process when you are crossing the road with your child.
STOP:  ‘Is this a good/safe place to cross?’
LOOK: ‘Is the car coming towards you or driving away? ‘Is the car going fast or 
slow? Can the driver see you?’
LISTEN:  ‘Can you hear any traffic? Remember you need to look and see where 
it is coming from!’
THINK: ‘ Is the road safe in both 
directions?’ ‘Do you think it’s safe to 
cross now?’
Bicycle safety
All children need to be taught cycling safety. Start teaching them good riding 
habits when they get their first bike. Children with UHL may experience two 
additional challenges when riding their bike:
• When riding on the pavement, children may not hear when a car is pulling  
 out of a driveway, and the driver may not be able to see them. They need  
 to learn to be cautious at each driveway.
• When riding on a bike track, they may not hear another bike coming from  
 behind or be able to decide which side to move when the rider rings their  
 bell. Rear vision mirrors or learning to ride on the left side of the path so  
 that other bikes can overtake may avoid a few unnecessary mishaps.
Talking to your child about their hearing loss and the extra 
precautions they must take will help them understand their 
responsibilities and keep them safe.
14 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024ADVOCATING FOR YOUR CHILD
Parents naturally want the best for their children and are uniquely positioned to 
understand their needs and speak up on their behalf. As parents of a child with 
UHL, you may need to become advocates—speaking up for your child to 
negotiate for services and support. Many parents find themselves becoming 
advocates when their child starts school, but there are numerous situations 
before school where advocacy skills can be beneficial, such as finding an early 
intervention service and starting child care or preschool.
Being an advocate for your child requires preparation and a well-informed 
approach. Here are some steps you can take to become an effective advocate:
Build relationships with professionals: Maintain a good working 
relationship with the professionals involved in your child's care. Ask questions, 
ensure you understand their responses, and don't hesitate to reach out to them. 
Educate yourself: Become informed about UHL, its potential effects, and 
outcomes for children with UHL. Know your child’s rights regarding services and 
support, and stay updated on research and any new or discontinued services 
for children with UHL.
Understand the system: Learn the rules, terminology, and jargon 
related to education and support services. This is particularly helpful when 
developing plans for the NDIS or advocating for support at school.
Keep records: Maintain thorough records, including reports from 
professionals and notes from phone calls or meetings. You can send follow-up 
letters or emails to clarify what was said and agreed upon.
State your case: Practice stating your case clearly, calmly, and 
confidently. Rehearse what you want to say beforehand to ensure you 
communicate effectively.
Sound Waves | 15
Teaching  your child self-advocacy skills
Your child can benefit from learning self-advocacy skills from an early age, as you 
won't always be there to speak up for them. There are a few things you can 
implement to help your child become an effective self-advocate:
Encourage independence:  Create opportunities for your child to be 
independent and advocate for themselves. Let them order for themselves in a 
café, ask a sales assistant for help, or share a concern with their teacher.
Provide the right vocabulary: Give your child the vocabulary and 
understanding of their hearing loss to explain their needs to others.
Promote problem-solving: Resist the urge to always jump in and solve 
problems for them. Allow your child to take the lead and lean on you only when 
necessary.
Practice communication:  Help your child practice ways of 
communicating their needs in an open and respectful manner.
The power of humour: Your child will likely face some awkward or 
challenging moments, and finding the funny side of some situations can help 
ease any tension and often earn the respect of those involved.
Mentorship: Introduce your child to someone older with UHL. Sharing 
experiences with a mentor can provide confidence and guidance for young 
people learning to negotiate their needs at school and in the wider world.
By advocating for your child and teaching them self-advocacy skills, you equip 
them with the confidence and tools to navigate challenges and express their 
needs effectively. These skills foster independence and resilience that will serve 
your child well throughout their life.
16 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024STARTING DAYCARE OR PRESCHOOL
Starting daycare or preschool for a child can feel like a big step, but with the right 
approach, you can find a service that suits your child and your family. 
Choosing the right service
Children with disabilities can enrol in any early childhood education or childcare 
service in Australia. When choosing a service, it’s important to communicate your 
child's needs and abilities early on to find the best match.
Key points to consider include your child's needs and interests, the staff's 
confidence and comfort in caring for your child, and whether there are other 
children with additional needs at the service. Talking to other parents, especially 
those with children with hearing loss, can provide valuable insights into the 
services you are exploring.
Setting your expectations
Before visiting any childcare centres, it’s a good idea to consider what you're 
looking for. Are you wanting a place where your child can socialise and receive 
supervision, or do you prefer a more specialised educational environment? Do 
you want the staff to have training in special needs, or are you comfortable 
providing guidance about your child's needs? Will a general childcare program 
suffice, or do you want something more specialised? Having clear expectations 
will make it easier to communicate your needs and narrow down your options.
When communicating with childcare providers, it's important to share 
information about your child's needs. Start by providing general information 
about your child's abilities and see how the provider responds. Don't hold back 
important details, as this could impact the level of care your child receives. Once 
you have narrowed down your choices, share more specific details about your 
child, such as their medical and physical needs, behavioural challenges, ways to 
comfort or calm them, and activities they enjoy or find challenging. Providing 
these details will help create a supportive environment for your child.
Sound Waves | 17Settling in
Selecting a childcare provider is the first step in establishing a long and positive 
relationship. Expect a period of adjustment as you and your child get used to the 
new routine. It's normal to encounter some challenges along the way, but stay 
positive and work through them. Observe how your child is adapting, and 
communicate any concerns with the childcare worker or supervisor. If you feel 
that the provider is not meeting your child's needs, address the issue early or 
consider other options. 
Every child adjusts differently, so give your child the time and space they need 
to settle in. Maintain open communication between you and the provider to 
maintain a nurturing environment where your child can thrive.

18 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024STARTING SCHOOL
Starting school is an exciting time in any child's life, but it can also be a source of 
stress for families with a child who has unilateral hearing loss. Questions run 
through your head, such as:
‘Is my child ready to start school?’
‘Which school will best suit my child's needs?’ 
‘Will the school provide the right listening environment 
for my child?’
A school will appreciate knowing well in advance (at least six or nine months 
before school starts) that your child will be attending their school. Early 
communication with the school allows them ample time to prepare for your 
child's arrival.
Is my child ready to start school?
School readiness depends on several factors, including your child's age and 
maturity level. Listen to the advice of preschool teachers and health professionals 
while also considering what you know about your child. 
Providing a stimulating learning environment at home will set the foundations for 
a successful transition to school. Here are some ways to do this:
• Read a range of books with your child, including fiction, non-fiction,  
 nursery rhymes, and poetry.
• Visit interesting places and expose your child to a broad range of   
 experiences. Discuss what they saw and learnt with them afterwards.
• Encourage social interactions with family and friends and nurture early  
 friendships.
• Give your child the vocabulary and understanding of their hearing loss to  
 explain their needs to others.
• Empower your child to advocate for themselves; they must do this   
 independently at school.
• Build their self-advocacy confidence in small, supportive settings so they  
 feel comfortable addressing their listening needs in the school   
 environment.
Sound Waves | 19Which school will best suit my child's 
needs?
Start your research and preparation early. Most children with UHL will attend 
mainstream schools and may receive few considerations. Therefore, ensuring the 
school understands your child's needs and can provide the necessary support for 
full access to the curriculum is crucial.
Visiting schools in your area is a good idea. Attend open days with your child to 
gauge their feelings about each school. Talking to other parents and students 
can provide valuable insights into the school community. Finally, arrange a 
meeting with the principal to discuss your child’s needs and ask any questions.
Will the school provide the right listening 
environment for my child?
Children with UHL need to concentrate harder to understand what is said in noisy 
environments. This can make them tired, which makes learning more difficult. A 
good listening environment at school makes a significant difference to children 
with UHL. Consider these questions when selecting a school:
• Are there other children with hearing loss at the school? If so, the staff may  
 have a better understanding of your child's needs, and a visiting teacher of 
 the deaf might be available to offer advice.
• How large are the classes? Larger classes are noisier, making it harder for  
 your child to hear.
• Where is the school located? Schools on main roads may be noisier,  
 making listening more challenging.
• Is the classroom design suitable? Avoid demountable and open-plan  
 classrooms, as these often have higher noise levels, making it harder to  
 understand what is being said in the classroom.
• Have the classrooms been acoustically treated? Look for classrooms with  
 carpeted floors, and acoustic tiles on the ceiling, as these features   
 improve the listening environment.
• What opportunities exist for parent involvement? As a parent of a child  
 with UHL, you should build solid relationships with the school staff. Good  
 communication and a willingness to be involved will foster a successful  
 partnership with the school.
20 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Have I made the right decision?
Families choose schools for many reasons, such as religious affiliations, family 
traditions, or the desire to send all their children to the same school. It may take 
some time to determine if you've made the right choice for your child with UHL. 
Flexibility is helpful, as what works for one child may not work for another. If you 
feel a different school environment might be better for your child's learning 
needs, exploring other options is worth considering. 
As children mature, it’s crucial to include them in any decision-making process 
about their schooling. Their input can provide valuable insights into their comfort 
levels, preferences, and any specific challenges they may face. By involving 
them, you empower your child, helping them feel more in control and confident 
about their school years.

https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/education/information-for-your-childs-teacher/classroom-tips/,Classroom tips,"When addressing the pupil say his/her name first and identify the topic you are covering.
Seat the pupil for optimal listening and visual cues within the classroom. Ideally, this should be with the pupil’s back to the window, seated one third of the distance of the room from the teacher, not in the front row directly beneath the teacher.
Beware of possible misunderstanding – avoid idioms, sarcasm, slang (if you use them, explain).
Sometimes ask other pupils if they have heard or understood rather than always focusing on the child with hearing loss.
Speak in an ordinary tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements, and at a normal rate of speaking.
Make sure your lips are clearly visible. Face the class, not the blackboard, when speaking.
Make sure the room does not have bright lights shining directly in the child’s face. Back-lighting is ideal.
Be aware that the pupil is unlikely to be able to lip read or fully hear during a film/slide presentation. Either use a captioned film or provide information (transcript) in advance.
Institute a buddy system – such as a classroom helper or official note-taker.
Provide an opportunity for the pupil to share information with the class about the hearing aid and/or FM system and how it works.
Request in-service instruction to learn how to check your puil’s hearing aids; keep extra batteries on hand.
Be aware that every child is an individual with his/her own strengths and limitations. Thus it is important not to have a preconceived notion of function based on the degree of hearing loss.
Remember always to speak naturally and clearly. If using exaggerated mouth movements, extremely fast or slow rates of speaking or overly loud speech, the pupil may have difficulty understanding.
Make sure always to make lip reading possible. Thus be careful not to chew gum or eat while talking to the pupils.
Remember always to make a recognisable transition when moving on to a new subject.
Consider passing around a written copy of the day’s and week’s assignments for all pupils, or writing assignments on the board.back to top"
https://www.aussiedeafkids.org.au/resources/education/information-for-your-childs-teacher/how-listener-friendly-is-your-classroom/,How listener friendly is your classroom?,"A good listening environment is crucial to successful classroom learning. Many factors affect the listening environment. Classrooms are typically noisy and reverberant, making listening difficult for pupils with normal hearing as well as those with hearing loss.
Check your classroom, using the following questions. If you discover that you have a poor listening environment (when no is answered to the following questions), follow the provided tips.
Classroom checklist and useful tips



1.
Noise outside the classroom
 Yes
 No


 


Is your classroom in a quiet area away from external noise sources (traffic, construction, playground, busy hallways, shops, etc.)?






 
Tip: Reduce external noise as much as possible by evaluating your classroom location. For a pupil with a hearing loss, choose a classroom located away from traffic and noisy areas. Avoid areas where groups of children congregate. Even simple things like shrubbery just outside the classroom windows can help reduce external noise.
 
 


2.
Noise inside the classroom
Yes
No


 


Do you have a quiet classroom without noise sources, such as fans, heating and cooling systems, etc.?






 


Is the floor carpeted?






 


Do the windows have curtains?






 


Do chairs, desks and tables have rubber stops to cut down on noise?






 

Tip: Evaluate and monitor internal classroom noises on an ongoing basis. Air conditioners, heating systems, computers, projectors and light fixtures can all contribute to internal background noise, making hearing difficult. Most of us simply “tune out” these sounds unconsciously. But for a child with hearing instruments it is not always that easy. Have equipment serviced regularly to eliminate noise created by malfunction. And look for areas where adjustments can be made to improve classroom acoustics:

Acoustically-treated low ceilings
Carpeting (floors, and even parts of walls)
Well-fitting doors
Thick curtains; acoustic panelling
Use of absorptive materials on hard reflective surfaces (cork bulletin boards etc.)
Windows and doors closed during instruction.


 
 


3.
Listening skills
Yes
No


 


Do you evaluate listening skills and provide programs to strengthen these skills?






 


Do you make listening fun?






 
Tip: Listening skills can be evaluated in many ways and they can fun. Contact the appropriate staff person in your school regarding the availability of pupil observation forms. Use game-like activities that make your pupils want to listen.
 
 


4.
Teacher’s voice
Yes
No


 


Are you projecting your voice so that you can be heard in the back of the room?






 
Tip: Check with pupils periodically to be certain that they can hear you well. Speak clearly, but do not yell. Even though a child may be wearing hearing aids, normal hearing cannot be achieved. Seating hard-of-hearing pupils near the front of the class should be strongly considered, unless FM assistive listening equipment1 is being used.
 
 


5.
Teacher’s language
Yes
No


 


When you speak, do you use clear, concise language?






 
Tip: Use age appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. If new words are introduced, explain them. Avoid excessive use of irony, figurative language and idioms. A child with a hearing loss is often concentrating on the literal translation. If the message is too complicated, pupils won’t listen or learn.
 
 


6.
Communication
Yes
No


 


Do you ensure that the pupils understand directions, both oral and written?






 


Do you use visual aids (video, overheads, etc.)?






 
Tip: Question pupils regularly regarding their understanding of written and oral directions. Do not assume that these are understood. Ask the pupil to repeat your instructions, rather than simply asking him/her if he/she heard you. Take care not to focus or single out the pupil with the hearing loss too much.
 
 


7.
Hearing tactics
Yes
No


 


Is there sufficient light in the room to aid oral communication with lip reading?






 


Do you try to talk face-to-face with your pupils?






 
Tip: A pupil with any type of hearing loss should face away from windows to avoid light shining in his/her face. The face of the speaker should be in good light. Speaking face-to-face enables the listener to utilise visual cues such as lip reading and facial expressions. Speak in a normal tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements. You should also model good listening habits by really listening to what your pupils are saying and showing interest. Schedule specific times for sharing information and give your full attention.

The following tips for good communication can be used with deaf children, young people and adults who use either speech or sign language (such as Auslan) and with those children who use a combination of both speech and signing.Make sure that you have your child’s attention before starting a conversation. Make sure you are facing your child and maintaining good eye contact. Try to be on the same level as them and allow some space for signing or lip-reading. (So, keep a distance of about one to two metres between you and your child). Use a well-lit room and don’t have your back to a window, as this creates a shadow and makes it difficult to read facial expressions or lip-read. Speak clearly, naturally and at a normal pace. Don’t shout, as it can appear to your child that you are angry and it also distorts lip patterns.  Try to make sure that background noise is kept to a minimum. Children with hearing aids, cochlear implants or those children with mild or unilateral deafness who do not use hearing aids may find it particularly difficult to pick out what is being said. A room that is carpeted or curtained will help to cut down the effects of noise in a room. If your child does not use sign language, it is still helpful to use your hands and facial expressions to gesture and support what you are saying. Don’t eat, smoke, or block the view of your face while you are speaking. If you have a beard or moustache, keep it trimmed. Also remember that glasses and sunglasses can make it difficult to maintain eye contact. When in a group, speak one at a time. It is helpful if the speaker raises their hand before talking so that your child knows who is speaking. Make sure you let your child know when there is a new topic of conversation. If a word or sign is not easily understood, use a more common word or sign with the same meaning. Be wary of using unusual words. Pause between sentences and check that your child has understood you, and that you have understood them.  Encourage them to stop you if they don’t understand what the conversation is about."

 Inclusive education policy
Version : 1.3 | Version effective : 10/08/2021
Audience
The Inclusive education policy applies department-wide including all state schools and educational settings.
Purpose
 This policy sets out the Department of Education ’s (the department ’s) commitment to continue to work towards a 
more inclusive state education system and the principles, which will guide that work. 
Policy statement
The department commits to continuing our journey towards a more inclusive education system at policy and 
regional levels, and as part of our everyday practice in schools, educational settings and classrooms.
Inclusive education means that students can access and fully participate in learning, alongside their similar-aged 
peers, supported by reasonable adjustments and teaching strategies tailored to meet their individual needs.
Inclusion is embedded in all aspects of school life, and is supported by culture, policies and every day practices.
Inclusive education differs from the following approaches and practices in significant ways:
Integration — students are placed in schools or educational settings with their similar-aged peers but 
adjustments are not made to meet their individual needs. This limits their ability to fully access or participate
in learning. Integration is not necessarily a step towards inclusion.
Segregation — students learn in separate environments, designed or used to respond to their particular 
needs or impairment, in isolation from other students.
Exclusion — students are unable to access any form of education.
The department ’s commitment to inclusive education
We have high expectations of all students, recognising that, with the right support, all students can succeed.
Our commitment means that children and young people across Queensland, from all social, cultural, community 
and family backgrounds, and of all identities and all abilities can:
attend their local state school and education centre and be welcomed
Page 2 of 6
Uncontrolled copy . Refer to the Department of Education Policy and Procedure Register at 
https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/inclusive-education-policy  to ensure you have the most  current version of this document.
access and participate in a high-quality education and fully engage in the curriculum alongside their similar-
aged peers
learn in a safe and supportive environment, free from bullying, discrimination or harassment
achieve academically and socially with reasonable adjustments and supports tailored to meet their learning 
needs.
The department will continue to offer parents the choice of enrolling their child, who meets set criteria in highly 
individualised programs, including through special schools and academies .
Principles
The department ’s work towards a more inclusive state education system will be guided by nine principles adapted 
from the United Nations ’ nine core features for inclusive education.
A system-wide approach
Inclusive education is implemented systemically, based on evidence, across the department including in schools 
and other educational settings. We promote and develop policies, programs and practices to remove barriers and 
promote inclusive education across the department and within local school communities.
Committed leaders
Leaders, at all levels within the department, across regions and local school communities, commit to and are 
accountable for implementing inclusive education. They promote a culture and shared values that remove barriers 
and support inclusion.
Whole of school
Every member of the school community, including teachers, support staff, volunteers, families and students, works 
collaboratively to ensure students can access and participate in all aspects of school life. Curriculum is provided to 
all students in ways that are age appropriate and responsive to diverse learning needs.
Collaboration with students, families and the community
We work with students, parents and caregivers, and other organisations, including teacher and professional 
associations, as respected and valued partners in inclusive education. We support students, parents, caregivers 
and families to have a voice and be heard. Their views are considered in decision making at all levels.
Respecting and valuing diversity
All students and families feel and are welcome, respected, included and safe at our state schools. We embrace 
and make visible diversity as a strength and support respectful relationships within the school community, and 
between students. We address the different barriers experienced by students and develop strategies and plans to 
support inclusive education for our diverse student population.

Uncontrolled copy . Refer to the Department of Education Policy and Procedure Register at 
https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/inclusive-education-policy  to ensure you have the most  current version of this document.
Confident, skilled and capable workforce
Our school leaders, teachers, department staff, support staff and volunteers build on their expertise to implement 
inclusive education practices. Good practice, based on evidence, is shared and cultural capability is strengthened. 
Continuous professional learning and mentorship is encouraged and supported.
Accessible learning environments
Our schools, educational settings and classrooms will be designed to enable students of all backgrounds, identities
and abilities to access and fully participate in learning. We ensure that students can access and participate in 
school activities and events.
Effective transitions
The transition from early childhood and care settings to school, and from school to work, training and higher 
education are significant milestones in students ’ lives. Schools continue to work in partnership with students, 
families, community organisations, professional groups, and other government and educational organisations to 
plan and support successful transitions at all points in a learner ’s education.
Monitoring and evaluation
Monit oring the progress and academic achievement of all students will continue to be a priority. Evaluation and 
reviews will occur at all levels – school, regional and system – to ensure the department is continuing on its journey
and to build on good practice.
Requirements
This policy requires the department and all state schools to comply with the Education (General Provisions)
Act 2006  (Qld) and state and commonwealth discrimination laws.
As different student groups experience different barriers to inclusion, the department will continue to 
implement strategies and policies, and support practices that address the unique needs  of:
oAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  students
ostudents from culturally and linguistically diverse  backgrounds
ostudents who identify as  LGBTIQ
ostudents living in out-of-home  care
ostudents from rural and remote  communities
ostudents with  disability
ostudents with mental health  needs
ogifted and talented  students.

Definitions
Term Definition
Discrimination Discrimination can be both direct and indirect. Direct discrimination involves treating 
someone less favourably than another person in similar circumstances because they 
have a characteristic, for example a disability or impairment, their gender, age, race, 
parental status, sexuality or cultural background. Indirect discrimination occurs when 
everyone is treated in exactly the same way even though this unreasonably 
disadvantages someone because they, or their associate, have a characteristic.
Inclusive education Inclusive education means that all students can access and fully participate in 
learning alongside their similar-aged peers. Teaching and learning strategies are 
adjusted to meet students ’ individual needs. Inclusive education encompasses all 
aspects of school life and is supported by culture, policies, programs and practices.
Reasonable adjustment An adjustment is a measure or action taken to assist a student with disability to 
participate in education on the same basis as other students. An adjustment is 
reasonable if it achieves this purpose while taking into account  the student ’s learning 
needs and balancing the interests of all parties affected, including those of the 
student with disability, the education provider, staff and other students (definition from
Disability Standards for Education 2005 (Cwlth) ).

Early Intervention & 
Education for Deaf and 
Hard of Hearing Children
Addressing challenges in pursuit of better outcomes

Foreword
Early intervention and education for deaf and hard of hearing children have 
always been vitally important but vexed issues.  Deaf Australia has been advocating 
in the interests of deaf and hard of hearing children since the organisation was 
established in 1986, and while we have seen improvements in some areas, on the 
whole early intervention and education have remained a challenge.
At our national conference in May 2011, 
education was identified as a priority for 
Deaf Australia. The community is concerned 
and frustrated that early intervention and 
education programs are still problematic. 
Deaf and hard of hearing people and their 
families also felt very strongly that the system 
is not listening to them. 
Deaf Australia organised a summit in 
November 2012 to give the community an 
opportunity to be heard. While politicians, 
academics and educators made an important 
contribution and provided informative 
presentations, the primary purpose was to 
hear from people at the coal face, on the 
lived experience of early intervention and 
school education. We asked participants to 
consider four basic questions:
1 What has worked for you?
2 What has not worked?
3 What needs to change? 
4 What can we do to help make this 
change happen? Many people came together at the summit 
and shared poignant and uplifting stories. We 
thank them for their honesty and willingness 
to share their experiences, wisdom and 
ideas with us. Deaf Australia gratefully 
acknowledges the funding and ongoing 
support provided by the Department of 
Families, Housing, Community Services and 
Indigenous Affair.
We also thank the summit facilitators: Leonie 
Jackson, Catherine Clark and Sue Izard; and 
Grant Thornton who generously donated 
their time and resources to assist us in this 
documentation. 
If the summit did one thing, it was to 
remind us all that there is great diversity 
among deaf and hard of hearing children 
and their families and there is no ‘one size fits 
all’ approach. It also confirmed that Auslan 
and the Deaf community are important 
components of early intervention and school 
education, and that our systems need to 
change to incorporate these elements to 
ensure parents, families and children are 
given greater choice. Based on what our summit participants 
told us, this report gives us a framework 
for our ongoing work towards better early 
intervention and school education for deaf 
and hard of hearing children. We encourage 
all summit participants, our partners, and 
leading educators to also feel an ‘ownership’ 
of this report and the strategies it sets out. 
This is so that we can all continue to work 
together on achieving the necessary changes 
identified at the summit. Deaf Australia 
cannot do it alone; we need all stakeholders 
to continue to work with us. Everyone’s 
contribution to the process is important and 
deeply appreciated.

Foreword
On the 29th and 30th of November, 2012, Deaf Australia held 
a national conference on Early Intervention & Education for 
Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children.
The conference was attended by people 
from all walks of life, with a diverse array of 
rich presentations and discussions. While 
politicians, academics and educators all 
presented, some of the most poignant and 
powerful stories came from those with direct 
experience, the parents of deaf children.
Clear themes came through all the 
discussion:
•	Real choice for children and their parents,
•	A recognition of the importance of Auslan
•	Respect for deaf culture 
•	More information 
This paper documents the rich discussions of 
the conference and finishes with an Action 
Plan for Deaf Australia.This decade will see more fundamental 
change in both the disability and not-for-
profit sector than in any previous time. 
More than ever organisations such as Deaf 
Australia need to be a key participant in the 
greater societal and political discourse on 
matters relating to the deaf community. 
If we want to ensure that there is no 
difference in life outcomes for deaf children 
when compared to their hearing peers, then 
the importance of early intervention and 
education for Deaf Australia becomes self-
evident. Deaf Australia can play a vital role in 
assuring that young deaf people have choice 
and access to the appropriate supports.

3  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children
Early intervention and education of Australia’s deaf and hard 
of hearing children are issues riddled with complexity. Introduction
One group committed to tackling these 
issues is Deaf Australia. As a national 
consumer-driven advocacy and information 
organisation, Deaf Australia endeavours 
to improve the quality of life for all 
deaf people. Run solely by members of 
the deaf community, the organisation 
collaborates with key stakeholders to advise 
government, industry and service providers 
on the needs of deaf people to ensure that 
Australia complies with the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disability. In the 26 years since inception, 
Deaf Australia has achieved a multitude of 
accomplishments, empowering the deaf 
community and increasing access to better 
services and information. Deaf and hard of hearing children are a 
particularly unique group represented by Deaf 
Australia. They are a varied group with many 
differences, but their age prevents them from 
lobbying for a better quality of life. Instead, 
Deaf Australia speaks for them, by raising 
awareness of the issues that impact the lives of 
these young individuals and their families. 
The challenges facing this particular 
demographic are, in fact, markedly complex. 
The timing of intervention and the type of 
education and support received by a deaf child 
have a direct and significant impact on their 
future, from the level of literacy they attain 
to the extent of their social development. 
Deaf Australia’s Vision:  Deaf people 
are respected and fully included in the 
Australian community and the right to 
use Auslan is legally recognised.Drawing on the presentations, workshops 
and feedback material from Deaf Australia’s 
recent Summit entitled, Early Intervention 
and Education for Deaf and Hard of 
Hearing Children , this paper summarises 
the main issues affecting this sector of 
the deaf community and subsequently 
suggests pragmatic strategies to address 
these challenges. The summit agenda 
included presentations from members of 
parliament, parents of deaf and hard of 
hearing children, academics and education 
professionals. 
This is an exciting time to be involved in 
the development of solutions related to the 
care of Australia’s deaf children. Much has 
already been achieved, and current policy 
changes are opening up opportunities to 
instigate change on a national level. 
There is still a lot to be done, however, 
until we can say with confidence that the 
level of long-term government support 
and social participation means that all 
members of Australia’s future generation, 
no matter the disability, have equal access 
and opportunity to education and the best 
quality of life possible.  
Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   4 
Communication permeates almost every aspect of our lives. Humans are 
inherently social, and one of the most enriching aspects of life is when we share 
our experiences and learn from others through exchange of thought and emotion. Setting the Scene
Thus it is imperative that we ensure that 
every child has the opportunity to develop 
their language skills to the utmost of their 
ability. In particular, it is important that at 
a young age, when the brain is still plastic, 
children form the neural pathways that 
provide them with language skills. If language 
is not acquired within a critical period then 
those pathways may never properly connect 
and the child’s ability to communicate may 
be compromised. 
How we approach these issues is largely 
dependent upon how one defines language. 
For deaf children, the misconception is that 
speech means language. On the contrary, 
language can manifest in many forms, verbal 
and non-verbal, through speech, script or 
visual communication. Each individual has 
the right to acquire and learn a language 
to native fluency most appropriate and 
accessible for them, which for deaf children 
may not necessarily be an oral language. In 
Australia it is important that deaf children 
do learn English at some point and acquire 
at least one language – either Auslan or 
English or both – to native fluency.  Which 
language comes first should be an informed 
decision by parents, to the child’s benefit. Deaf children need access to both Auslan and 
English from the beginning and we need to 
move away from the medical concept that a 
child must learn to communicate in either 
speech or sign and dispel the misconception 
that blending both languages will result 
in failure to communicate. Parents of deaf 
children, however, are often not fully informed 
of the positives and challenges associated with 
their subsequent choices for Early Intervention 
and School Education options. 
A primary driver behind Deaf Australia 
holding the recent summit was the 
dissatisfaction and confusion that parents 
of deaf children have with the current state 
of education offerings for their children. 
Despite Prime Minister Julia Gillard recently 
highlighting education as a national priority, 
the benefits of having the world’s top 
performing students is undermined if there 
is a long tail of underperforming students. 
Unfortunately, deaf children are often in  
this trial, two standard deviations outside  
of the average. 
Although the reforms currently being 
established have given rise to an exciting time 
for educators and disability advocates, they 
are, however, by no means done deals, and 
significant negotiation with states, territories 
and the Council of Australian Government 
(COAG) is yet to conclude. The government 
is committed to 
lifting the assistance 
provided to students 
with a disability 
to make sure they 
benefit from a 
fulsome education 
and meaningful 
participation in the 
community.

Government disability reforms
There are approximately 172,000 school 
students in Australia with extra needs, most 
of who are in the government school system.1 
The government is unaware of the level of 
adjustment that those students need because, at 
this point in time, this data is not available at 
a national level. Nevertheless, through various 
initiatives, the government is attempting to 
shift the paradigm to focus on the needs of 
individual students. The reforms most relevant 
to deafness are as follows. 
The Gonski Report and the National 
Plan for School Improvement
The Australian Government currently invests 
approximately $13.6 billion in education 
per year.2 To maximise the benefit of this 
significant investment and to ensure that 
schools are prepared for future demand, in 
2010 the government commissioned a full 
Review of Funding for Schooling (commonly 
referred to as the Gonski Report), headed by 
David Gonski. The first review of its kind in 
40 years, the panel analysed more than 7,000 
submissions, visited 39 schools and consulted 
71 key education groups across Australia.
Released in 2011, the Gonski Report clearly 
argues that, “Australia lacks a logical, consistent 
and publicly transparent approach to school 
funding.”3 In terms of its specific reference to 
education and disability, the report highlights 
the differences in levels of support across state 
and territories, as well as the lack of consistency 
with regards to the collection and reporting of 
data on this cohort. 
One of the outcomes of the Gonski Report 
was the establishment of the National Plan 
for School Improvement. This initiative, to be 
phased in over six years from 2014, aims to 
help every Australian child get a world-class 
education, no matter where they live, the 
school they attend, or their family background.4
 Specific objectives relevant to deaf children 
include new funding benchmarks, increased 
training and professional development for 
teachers, extra support for children with 
disabilities or from low income families and 
increased transparency and accountability 
regarding schools’ performance.
National Disability Strategy
The National Disability Strategy is based 
on the findings of extensive consultation 
conducted in 2008-09 by the National 
People with Disabilities and Carer Council.5 
Published in 2011, the document outlines 
a ten year national plan for improving life 
for Australians with disability, their families 
and carers.6 With the vision of an Australia 
which enables people with disability to fulfil 
their potential in the social and economic 
life of our community, the strategy aims to 
establish a high level policy framework to 
guide government across mainstream and 
disability-specific policy, drive performance 
improvement of mainstream services 
towards people with disability, and to 
promote awareness and inclusion of people 
with disability.Six broad outcome areas provide the 
structure of the strategy. These are:
1Inclusive and accessible communities
2Rights protection, justice and legislation
3Economic security 
4Personal and community support
5Learning and skills 
6Health and well-being
The strategy has been proclaimed as an 
historic milestone, as it is the first time in 
Australian history that all governments, 
local, State and Commonwealth have 
committed to a unified national approach 
to improving the lives of people with 
disability as well as those of their families 
and carers. 
Launched in February 2012, the strategy adopts a tripartite staged approach:  
Phase One Phase Two Phase Three

National Disability Insurance Scheme 
(NDIS)
A direct product of the National Disability 
Strategy, the NDIS is an account-based 
model of provision.  The principle 
underlying the scheme is the provision of 
social insurance and ensuring that there are 
sufficient funds to support those who need it. 
The aim is to transition away from the crisis-
driven approach that has existed in the past, 
in which governments have had to plead with 
their treasurers for funds, to a position where 
the number of people and exact amount 
needed is known on an annual basis. The 
tangible outcome will be to determine the 
real figure needed to support the 410,000 
people in the country who the Productivity 
Commission identified as needing an on-
going package into the future.7 Deaf and hard 
of hearing children belong to this group and 
hence will directly benefit from this change.
The NDIS reform is designed to address 
a key point expressed in the Productivity 
Commission inquiry report on disability 
care and support. The rationale was that the 
relatively lower rates of education among 
people with disability may be attributed to 
factors besides disability itself. The report 
noted that high quality educational  
outcomes require an appropriate mix of 
support and community receptiveness as 
well as the involvement of people with the 
disability themselves. 
The scheme is in a very nascent stage. 
Legislation was introduced in the House 
of Representatives at the end of November 
2012 and has now been referred to the Senate 
Community Affairs Legislation committee. 
That committee will then undertake a series 
of consultations around the community to 
tackle key challenges such as workforce issues, 
transition phases and the establishment of 
data collection standards. This inquiry is 
expected to carry through to February 2013 
and then the final bill with be voted on in the 
House of Representatives and the Senate. This means that now, more than ever, is 
the time for the Deaf community to voice 
concerns and express suggestions regarding 
funding, resources and the cultural shift that 
must take place for the NDIS to be a success.
Current funding provision 
Although the aforementioned reforms are 
under development, the government already 
has a number of state-wide initiatives in 
operation to provide disability funding. 
The Department of Education and Early 
Childhood Development in Victoria is 
providing access to live captioning technology 
services to improve participation in education 
for secondary school students, in NSW the 
Catholic Education Commission is supporting 
the development of devices at a school level 
and in Tasmania the Department of Education 
is using their funds to gain access to a range of 
online tools for hearing impairment.
A recent national initiative, launched in 2012, 
is More Support for Students with Disabilities. 
This provides educational institutions with 
more than $200 million over two years to 
ensure that schools and teachers have the 
support they need to cater for students 
with disability.8 An example of the benefits 
realised from this program can be seen at 
St Michael’s School on Queensland’s Palm 
Island. Children at this school experience a 
number of conditions, one of them being ear 
disease. With the addition of hearing loops 
in classrooms, the learning environment was 
improved significantly, as was reflected in the 
school’s drastically improved NAPLAN score. 
A shift in the way that funding is distributed 
is underway. While initiatives such as More 
Support for Students with Disabilities  
provide institutions with support, other 
programs are beginning to distribute funds 
directly to the end consumer, allowing the 
people with needs themselves to elect from 
where they receive their support. One such 
initiative is Better Start for Children with 
Disability (Better Start).Better Start
Since its launch on 1 July 2011, 
Better Start has distributed funds to 
the families of over 5,000 disabled 
children. Deaf and hard of hearing 
children are one of the five eligible 
groups under the scheme, and once 
they register through Carers Australia, 
they can gain access to up to 
$12,000 in funding for allied therapies 
and other early intervention supports 
to assist their development. Additional 
assistance is available for children 
who live in remote areas to help them 
access services.
One of the strengths of the Better 
Start model, where the money is in 
the hands of the parent or carer of the 
child, is the greater choice and control 
that they have to choose their therapy 
options. As a quality assurance 
measure, however, Better Start 
funding can only be used for services 
from registered training organisations, 
which can provide logistical difficulties 
especially for families wanting to learn 
Auslan as funding is only available for 
accredited Auslan courses provided by 
RTOs, which are largely inflexible and 
do not meet the lifestyle and training 
needs of families. Community entry 
level course offerings are not eligible 
due to their non-accredited status.
The age limit for children is up to 7 
years of age, and the program justifies 
this by the evidence that suggests 
that treatment during this timeframe 
generates the greatest return on 
investment.
The program places particular 
emphasis on the transition from 
pre-school to primary school, and 
is intended to complement existing 
Commonwealth and State and 
Territory government services, 
to ensure these children are as 
supported and prepared as possible.7 Productivity Commission. (2011). Disability Care and Support. Productivity Commission Inquiry Report. No. 54, 31 July 2011.

The early years lay the foundations for every child’s future success.Community Challenges – 
Early Intervention
Early Intervention in the context of this paper 
is defined as intervention programs that occur 
in a child’s life during the period from birth 
until primary school. 
As outlined in Deaf Australia’s advice to 
FaCSIA, Policy on Early Intervention for 
Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children,9 the 
importance of Early Intervention is paramount. 
It has the potential not only to enable deaf 
children to acquire and develop native fluency 
in a language, but also to develop a positive 
self-image and to be confident about their 
identity and place in the world.  The past decade has seen significant impact 
on outcomes for children because of Early 
Intervention. A key catalyst for this has been 
the introduction of Universal Newborn 
Hearing Screening, which was rolled out 
nationally in 2002. Today, 97% of Australia’s 
children have their hearing screened at or 
soon after birth. This dramatic increase in 
early identification of hearing problems has 
consequently impacted both the volume of 
cochlear implants being issued and the age 
at which this is done. These application of 
devices remains somewhat contentious for 
Deaf Australia because although they can 
give children early access to sound, they 
The three major types of Early Intervention programs are:10
Auditory –verbal / Oral-aural Total Communication Bilingual / Bicultural
Focuses on the use of even minimal amounts of 
amplified hearing to develop spontaneous speech 
and to process language in a natural way through 
auditory pathways. These programs aim to enable 
children with hearing impairment to learn to listen, 
understand spoken language and communicate 
through speech using their residual hearing, and in 
the oral-aural approach, using lip-reading as well. 
These programs usually place the parent in the role 
of primary educator.Focuses on the use of a wide range of methods 
of communication including speech, lip-reading, 
listening, signing and finger spelling. These various 
methods of communication may be used alone 
or in combination with each other. When speech 
and signing are used together this is known as 
simultaneous communication. Simultaneous 
communication is used to manually represent 
English using a sign system known as signed 
English.Focuses on education through two languages, 
Auslan and English. English is taught as a second 
language via reading and writing or through sign 
systems representing English, and speech. In 
many educational programs and school settings, 
children who are deaf or hearing-impaired may learn 
about the deaf community and its history, language 
and culture, as well as learning about the hearing 
community.Community Challenges – Early Intervention
can also create the expectation that those 
children are cured and no longer require 
other support services. For children who 
receive a cochlear implant but do not 
receive full benefits from the device, they 
may lose valuable intervention from a 
more suitable approach. The majority of 
Early Intervention support is funded by 
State Government (health funding, speech 
development), and basically no funding 
is available for language (sign language) 
development. They are being entwined 
in Better Start scheme, but the current 
Auslan programs eligible for funding are not 
suitable for families as there is no support 
for all family members to participate.

While we continue to see this diversity we cannot have 
a one-size-fits-all approach to educating children.
Professor Greg Leigh, 
Director of the Renwick Centre for Professional Education and Research at the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind ChildrenVariability of outcomes
Although recent progress in the field of 
early intervention has brought about 
significant improvement for deaf children’s 
spoken language development, outcomes 
achieved continue to be characterised with 
considerable variability. Despite popular 
media representations, universal success 
is far from reality, thus a single strategy 
approach to educating deaf children is at 
this stage unfeasible.  This section of the paper explores the 
issues concerning Early Intervention as 
were raised at the recent Deaf Australia 
summit. These include:
1Variability of outcomes 
2First language acquisition
3Information transparency 
4Family centric service provision
5Availability of bilingual programs
6Acceptance supportImpact of Early Identification: The Long-term Outcomes 
for Children with Hearing Impairment (LOCHI) Study
The LOCHI study, which has been 
underway since 2006, examines 
the impact of earlier identification 
of hearing loss on children’s general 
development. The study is headed by 
the National Acoustics Laboratory in 
Sydney, and tracks the longitudinal 
development of 475 children who have 
been identified with hearing loss in New 
South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.
 
These locations were selected because 
at the time of the study’s inception, 
these states were at different stages 
of the introduction of newborn hearing 
screening, resulting in half of the 
subjects having had their hearing 
loss identified and hearing aids fitted 
by six weeks of age, the other half 
on average at an age of 18 months, 
making for a clear comparison across 
the identification timeframe.
 
The first phase of the study focuses on 
development up to five years of age 
with the second phase testing children 
up to nine years of age.
 
Ching, T. (2012). The Longitudinal Outcomes of Children with Hearing Impairment (LOCHI) study. 
Powerpoint slides from presentation at the First Voice Meeting 2012The study is not yet complete, however 
the large bank of assessments that 
these children have already undertaken 
at critical points of their development 
have already generated a huge amount 
of data from which statistically sound 
conclusions have been drawn. One 
factor that proved to be significant 
in predicting outcomes was the age 
at which children receive cochlear 
implants. In terms of both receptive and 
expressive language skills, children who 
received cochlear implants before the 
age of 12 months achieved significantly 
higher levels of language ability than 
those who received cochlear implants 
after that time. In discussing the 
benefits of earlier identification of 
hearing loss through universal newborn 
hearing screening, the researchers 
have noted that earlier identification 
directly facilitates the ability to provide 
children with a cochlear implant at an 
earlier age (i.e., before the age of 12 
months). Prior to the advent of newborn 
hearing screening, the average age at 
which children were identified as having 
severe to profound hearing loss was 
greater than 18 months.
Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   10 

There are a range of factors that influence the level of success that a deaf child will 
achieve. The obvious element is the type and degree of the child’s hearing loss, however 
evidence suggests many other factors are also at play:First language acquisition
There is an important distinction between 
acquiring and learning a language. The 
former is a natural, subconscious process, 
during which the individual is unaware of 
grammatical rules. During first language 
acquisition, children get a feel for what is 
correct and what is not, and in order to do so, 
they need to be exposed to a source of natural 
communication. The emphasis is on the text 
of the communication and not on the form. 
Language learning, on the other hand, is 
not communicative. It is the result of direct 
instruction in the rules of language, and it 
certainly is not an age-appropriate activity for 
children in their first years of life. 
In general, hearing children acquire their 
first language with comparative ease because 
they are constantly exposed to accessible, 
language-rich environments. Deaf and hard 
of hearing children, however, face a greater 
challenge, as their natural first language may 
not be an oral language at all. Recent findings 
emerging from the field of neuroscience have 
demonstrated that neural pathways in the 
brain make connections related to language 
development during a critical period of child 
development. MRI scanning has shown 
that if access to an appropriate language is 
delayed then the pathways do not connect 
in the usual way and do not produce the 
same level of flexibility that a person requires 
to develop appropriately fluent language. 
The development of cognitive processing 
and language functional centres are directly 
related to a child’s age of first language 
acquisition. If a deaf child is only exposed to a 
spoken language, even if they have an assistive 
device such as cochlear implants, then these 
neural pathways may never properly form, 
and they may never acquire native fluency 
in any language. This means that they will 
instead have to attempt to learn language via 
speech and listening therapy. While this diversity among the population of deaf children continues to be seen, and 
if it is acknowledged that a single approach to early intervention support and service is 
inadequate, it is important to then take the next step to develop alternative pathways for 
children. The challenge lies in designing a variety of strategies to identify which children 
are going to pursue which pathway at the earliest possible time. Type and

11  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children

Although some children are successful in a 
monolingual environment, the probability 
of any particular child’s success cannot be 
reliably predicted. Therefore, in order to 
ensure that the communication potential of 
hearing impaired children is not hindered, a 
key challenge is to shift the educational system 
perception from the view that children should 
stay with one option, even if it is not working 
for them, rather than try other methods to 
which the child may better respond.
Furthermore, this identification of which of 
the Early Intervention pathways the hearing 
impaired child should pursue should be 
made as early as possible because research 
has also demonstrated the negative outcomes 
of what has been termed the late arrival 
effect. This is when children have pursued 
one mode of language education, such as 
the auditory-verbal method for a period of 
time with limited success, and then they 
switch to a different method which resonates 
more naturally with them, such as a signed 
language, yet the level of fluency they attain 
in either is less than a hard of hearing child 
who utilised the method most appropriate for 
them from an earlier stage. 
Native level proficiency in a first language 
also affects how easily one learns a second 
language. This further stresses the need for 
deaf children to have the opportunity for 
language acquisition, as this will facilitate 
the ease of learning a second language, such 
as English, which they may then use as a 
communication tool for interaction with 
hearing people. 
Aside from the challenge of designing a 
continuum of program options to account 
for language diversity between deaf children, 
another major issue is that the significance of 
acquiring a language to native fluency, and 
the difference between this and having to 
learn a first language, is rarely, if ever, clearly 
explained to parents. Information transparency
In fact, this challenge of ensuring that parents are adequately informed of their 
child’s development potential is a multi-faceted issue, encompassing problems 
of information accessibility, attitudes of industry professionals and methods of 
information delivery. Discovering that their child has a hearing impairment can 
be overwhelming for many parents and the first contact that a parent has with 
the Australian system is usually with a professional with a medical perspective. 
Parents are usually bombarded with complex and conflicting information and 
requested to make major decisions within tight timeframes. The initial message 
that is usually delivered by the health professional is that the child has a medical 
problem, which can be fixed with a medical solution (such as a cochlear implant). 
The first issue here, and one which was raised constantly throughout the summit, 
is the negative attitude of many industry professionals. The following quotes are 
from parents of hearing impaired children who presented on their experiences of 
their child being diagnosed with hearing impairments:
“We have to sit through appointment after appointment  
being told that our child is not good enough, that our  
child needs to be fixed.”
“If I can speak to the professionals and the medical 
people and the educational people, please, our children 
are more than just a pair of ears. They are actually 
whole human beings; a little person with emotional, 
psychological and physical needs.”
“When you go to the service providers and to the 
doctors and there are so many appointments where you 
hear that your child is broken it is a relief to find the 
Deaf community and see how rich it is, culturally and 
linguistically. It is really beautiful.”
Parents of Deaf and Hard of Hearing children, Early Intervention  
and Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children Summit
Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   12 

Evidently, the challenge here is to educate 
service professionals so that they understand 
that deafness is something that can be 
embraced. Communicating to parents 
that a deaf person’s life can still be rich and 
fulfilling is likely to assist parents in dealing 
with the initial shock of their child having a 
hearing impairment.
The second issue is the availability of 
information. Medical experts who promote 
cochlear implants have a tendency to 
present these devices as a solution, without 
explaining that while they increase the 
child’s hearing potential, they guarantee 
no outcomes with regards to language 
development. The most common resource 
that parents receive once their child has been 
diagnosed is Australian Hearings’, Choices 
booklet. While this publication claims to 
outline all of the available education and 
therapy options, many participants in the 
summit argued that it was heavily biased 
towards the use of technology devices and 
the auditory-verbal approach. Finally, the way in which parents receive 
information, in terms of both time and 
medium, is inadequate to make fully 
informed decisions. Parents are generally 
flooded with information all at once and only 
once, and if they are unfamiliar with deafness, 
then they are usually unable to recognise 
the biases behind various suggestions. 
Information booklets may not be as accessible 
and understandable to some parents as other 
types of media such as videos. It would be really nice if Early Intervention services 
were not either/ or, but if they could be both. To enable 
families a total communication package rather than 
having to make a choice when they have so very little 
information to make it with. When your child has just 
been diagnosed, it’s very hard to say, well, this is what 
I’m going to do for the rest of their life. It’s just too hard.
Parents of Deaf and Hard of Hearing children, Early Intervention  
and Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children Summit  
Overall, the challenges with regards to 
transparency of information include 
changing the attitudes of industry 
professionals and developing a more robust 
collection of information resources that is 
available in a range of forms, and which can 
be accessed at any time. Community Challenges – Early Intervention
13  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children
Rebecca’s Story
Rebecca is a mother of four who has 
experienced frustration navigating 
Early Intervention options for her deaf 
children. She herself is deaf, but also 
has the ability of oral speech.
When her second child was born in 
Sydney (2004) and Rebecca and 
her husband realised that their son 
was deaf, they went to the Australian 
Hearing Centre to find out what to do. 
In response they were told to just go 
home and sign with him and not to 
bother doing anything else. Rebecca, 
however, wanted better quality of 
life for her son so both parents 
decided to opt for hearing aids for 
their child. When they went to get the 
hearing aids they were again told by 
professionals that they were a waste of 
time and money considering that both 
parents could sign. But Rebecca was 
committed and persistent and in the 
end her son got the hearing aids and 
embarked on starting speech therapy. 
Again, when speaking with the Early 
Intervention centre to organise this 
they laughed at her for choosing this 
path for her son when both parents 
were deaf. Rebecca insisted however 
that this didn’t matter and that her 
son needed access to speech and 
audiology and hearing services. As a 
result of the effort required to achieve 
the desired outcomes, Rebecca gave 
up work and became heavily involved 
in deaf sports, deaf work, to focus on 
her son and to advocate for him to have 
access to a range of Early Intervention 
services, such as interpreters and 
speech therapy training. Family-centric service provision
The other issue that was voiced with 
overwhelming consensus from the parent 
expectations component of the summit was 
the need for Early Intervention support 
services to consider not only the child, 
but also their family. The call for increased 
flexibility was supported by numerous stories, 
all of which shared the underlying premise 
that without sound logistical support, 
the success of the child’s development 
was potentially compromised. After all, 
those children cannot drive themselves to 
appointments nor practice sign language 
on their own. Many parents work during 
business hours yet service providers do 
not accommodate after hours visits. These 
organisational difficulties create further 
obstacles in an already challenging process.
If the service provision paradigm did indeed 
broaden to include the needs of the family, a 
key area for change would be the increase of 
accessibility for the entire family to learn sign 
language. There is currently very little support 
available for families to receive training such 
as Auslan in the home, due largely to the fact 
that providers must be linked to an RTO 
(and few currently have this accreditation). 
Many parents have to travel significant 
distances to attend University-style classes, 
in which the timing, style and location of 
lessons are inconvenient. 
Even if families are able to gain access to basic 
Auslan courses, the subsequent challenge is 
finding where to then develop a greater level 
of complexity of this language. If their child’s 
primary language is Auslan, parents need an 
advanced level of the language to keep ahead 
of or even keep up with their children. There 
was reported difficulty from many parents 
regarding knowledge of where to find that 
advanced training. A clear call was voiced at 
the summit for government to intervene and 
not only supply funding to programs, but to 
also adapt policies to encourage the use and 
learning of Auslan. When Rebecca’s third child was born 
profoundly deaf, she also experienced 
similar pushback from the industry 
in her pursuit of cochlear implants 
for her child. It was important to 
Rebecca that all of her children had 
the same access to communication 
development, meaning an equal 
opportunity for a thriving social and 
academic life. The Sydney Cochlear 
Implant Centre in Sydney asked 
Rebecca, “how can you possibly make 
cochlear implants work for your child 
when you’re deaf and can’t provide 
access to sounds and talking?” 
Rebecca replied that nothing is 
impossible and that they would find a 
way. And indeed they did, as her child 
is now six and has undertaken Early 
Intervention strategies successfully.
When interviewed at the Deaf Australia 
Summit Rebecca expressed that she 
wished we could change the way that 
organisations approach deafness. She 
advocates for a total communication 
strategy that provides auralism, 
signed language and English. 
Rebecca’s story highlights the 
importance of respecting parents 
and providing access for children to 
whichever Early Intervention strategy 
that they will best respond.
Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   14 
The final note regarding the challenge of 
shifting service provision to a more family- 
centric model is unrelated to Auslan yet still 
directly impacts the whole family’s journey. 
Again it pertains to the realm of logistics, 
and also concerns the lack of communication 
between various support services. There were 
numerous reports of appointment times 
being wasted by having to relay information 
about what had happened in other therapy 
or educational sessions back and forth. 
Addressing the challenge of the lack of 
communication between services would 
increase efficiency and minimise frustration 
felt by the child and their family.  
Availability of bilingual programs
The variability of outcomes for deaf and 
hard of hearing children means that a wide 
range of Early Intervention options need 
to be made available. A current challenge is 
the supply of bilingual programs. Bilingual 
programs use both English and Auslan to 
communicate with the child in the hope of 
enabling the child to acquire two languages 
equally or at least one to native fluency 
and the other to a level that can be used to 
interact competently with the hearing and 
Deaf communities. Exposing children to 
both languages mitigates the risk of choosing 
a language with which the child does not 
suit, thus limiting their chances of native 
fluency in any language. 
While bilingual approaches to education 
allow deaf people cognitive and social 
development and the opportunity to 
maximise their literacy capability, currently 
only three percent of Australia’s deaf and 
hard of hearing children are receiving a 
bilingual education. This is because it is 
rare for Auslan to exist in an environment 
alone. Furthermore, offering Auslan as an 
option does not automatically mean that 
the approach is bilingual, with one language 
usually emphasized earlier over another. One of the possible reasons for the lack 
of bilingual programs relates to the status 
of Auslan. The current trend within 
the medical profession is to favour the 
auditory-verbal/oral-aural method and 
discourage parents from choosing Auslan, 
claiming that if children have the option 
of signing first, then they will not develop 
speech. Deaf Australia believes that this 
approach is inappropriate, inadequate and 
potentially damaging to the child and does 
not promote family relationships.11
United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
Article 24 – Education
3 States Parties shall enable persons with disabilities to learn life and social 
development skills to facilitate their full and equal participation in education 
and as members of the community. To this end, States Parties shall take 
appropriate measures, including:
a Facilitating the learning of Braille, alternative script, augmentative and 
alternative modes, means and formats of communication and orientation and 
mobility skills, and facilitating peer support and mentoring;
b Facilitating the learning of sign language and the promotion of linguistics 
identity of the deaf community;
c Ensuring that the education of persons, and in particular children, who are 
blind, deaf or deafblind, is delivered in the most appropriate languages and 
modes and means of communication for the individual, and in environments 
which maximise academic and social development.
United National Convention Rights of Persons with DisabilitiesThe challenge to increase the supply of 
bilingual education programs is championed 
by the World Federation of the Deaf (WFD), 
an international organisation which represents 
the rights of 72 million deaf people globally. In 
2008, the Australian Government ratified the 
United Nations convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and its protocols.  
The challenge now is to transfer this political 
recognition into tangible outcomes, in which 
the elevated status of Auslan drives the 
expansion of opportunity for bilingual Early 
Intervention programs.Early Intervention Program Offerings

6Community Challenges – Early Intervention
15  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children

Acceptance Support
A parent’s internal acceptance process when 
told that their child is hearing impaired can 
be complex and confusing. Those who have 
had no or little contact with a deaf adult or 
member of the deaf community prior to their 
child’s diagnosis are often overwhelmed with 
a sense of helplessness. At the summit, many 
parents commented that they wished there 
were ways to connect with other parents of 
hearing impaired children and deaf adults, 
so that they could provide practical and 
emotional support. A number of volunteer 
parent support groups are actually already 
in operation, however accessibility to the 
information about these groups is poor. 
Further to this, many new parents never 
receive exposure to success stories of deaf 
individuals. Acknowledging that a child with 
a disability can still have a high quality of 
life is a challenge that may be overcome if 
families are connected with appropriate deaf 
role models. This would help to dissipate 
much of the misinformation received from the 
medical community and quell unnecessary, 
yet common, concerns of parents.  Lesley’s Story
Lesley (WA) is the mother of a seven 
year old profoundly deaf boy. During 
her interview at the Summit, Lesley 
commented that what has worked well 
for her in the system has been the 
support and access to Auslan. Yet the 
journey has not been easy for Lesley 
and her family, involving seven years 
of hard lobbying to gain access to 
Auslan. Lesley fought for this because 
she realised the importance of her son 
having a strong first language, and as 
a deaf child, this appeared to her to 
naturally be Auslan.
In fact, the challenge of lack of Auslan 
support for the family meant that 
Lesley’s husband had to give up work 
for two years to attend TAFE full time, 
which proved a great financial strain on 
the household. Following this, Lesley 
herself attended TAFE part-time for two 
years to learn Auslan.
Currently Lesley is fighting to lift 
the cap on admissions for Shenton 
College for Deaf Education Centre 
in Western Australia. Co-located with 
a mainstream school and providing 
comprehensive support for hearing 
impaired children, the government 
has told the school that they may 
not increase admissions from their 
current 25 students. This means that 
her son has no chance of entering this 
school, even though he would benefit 
greatly from the community and social 
aspects, specialist English programs, 
note-takers and translators.  In line with comments from other 
parents, Lesley highlighted the 
negativity overshadowing the medical 
process. She was constantly told that 
her child was broken, will not amount 
to much, and needs to be fixed. As 
Lesley’s family had no history of 
deafness, the diagnosis of her son 
came as a shock, and this negative 
attitude made the acceptance phase 
more difficult for the family. This was 
until, at 18 months, Lesley took her 
child to an Early Interventional bilingual 
playgroup run by WA Deaf Society. It 
was here that, for the first time, Lesley 
witnessed her son being celebrated in 
a positive environment.
The Deaf community has been a 
huge source of encouragement for 
Lesley and her family. As her son was 
actually the first deaf person she had 
met, Lesley claims that at first she 
did not understand that deafness is 
not just about ears, rather it is the 
whole identity that goes with it. There 
is immense deaf pride in this minority 
people group, and now Lesley works 
hard at fostering that pride in her son. 
She has accepted that he is not an 
inadequate broken hearing person, and 
that while the technology is fantastic 
and has its place, his hearing aids do 
not define who he is. Wearing them 
or not, her son remains a beautiful, 
intelligent little deaf boy.

Community Challenges – 
School Education
17  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children
The continuing development of children involves managed 
transition into a supportive education environment.
Community Challenges –  
School Education
The post Early Intervention journey of deaf 
and hard of hearing children involves the 
transition into school life. To ensure that this 
paper’s analysis is comprehensive, this next 
section focuses on challenges for deaf children 
which relate to their school education. The 
scope of this covers primary and secondary 
school, up until the end of Year 12. 
School education in Australia is state-based, 
thus the programs and levels of support 
offered for deaf and hard of hearing children 
differ from region to region. This means that 
the issues and challenges are also varied across 
the country. To highlight these differences, 
this chapter begins with a comparative 
outline of the current situation and progress 
underway in three geographic locations  
across Australia.
NSW
In NSW, there are a number of initiatives 
aimed particularly at providing professional 
learning support for teachers, which assist 
them to understand the Commonwealth 
standards. A course for mainstream teachers 
will also soon be introduced to teach them 
about hearing loss and hearing impairment 
and how to better support students who are 
in the mainstream system. Finally, increases  
in captioning and the amount of support  
staff in Auslan learning have been proposed 
for the near future, indicating a shift from  
the past, where Auslan was not used in  
NSW schools at all. Victoria
In the Victorian system, there are currently 
three different schooling options for deaf 
and hard of hearing students. In addition 
to mainstream schools, there are three deaf 
specialist schools and 19 deaf facilities. 
Following a recent review of deaf education, 
the Victorian Deaf Education Institute was 
established, which is currently working 
on facing challenges regarding workforce 
development, technology in the classroom, 
mentoring services, access and inclusion, 
individual pathways and post school options. 
South Australia
In South Australia, 91% of all children with 
hearing loss are educated in a mainstream 
setting. There are six centres for hearing 
impairment, however historically they have 
struggled for numbers due to complex 
verification criteria.  An Auslan reference 
group has recently been formed to tackle 
this issue, as well as other challenges such 
as reaching children in remote areas and 
developing competency standards for 
teachers of the deaf through performance 
management tools.  
From these snapshots it is evident that school 
education provision for hearing impaired 
children is riddled with complexities. These 
are magnified by the many considerations 
at the time of enrolment, just prior to a 
deaf child’s school commencement. These 
include the level of the child’s hearing loss, the age of the child at diagnosis, the child’s 
preferred communication method, whether 
the child has an implant or has hearing aids, 
and their particular educational requirements. 
Corresponding support may include 
reasonable adjustments to meet the individual’s 
needs, access to teachers with particular 
experience (such as teachers of the deaf), or 
additional support through the classroom such 
as interpreters, captioning and note takers. 
The second day of the summit dealt with 
School Education of hearing impaired 
children, and to complement the 
presentations, extensive workshops were 
also conducted. The challenges and issues 
as presented in this paper are largely drawn 
directly from participant brainstorming 
sessions. Eight different scenarios relating to 
deaf children’s school education experience 
were presented and groups were asked to 
identify what worked well in the situation, 
what did not work well, what were the areas 
for improvement, and what strategies would be 
appropriate to effect those changes. The major 
issues identified can be categorised into the 
following three broad themes:
•	Quality of bilingual programs and support 
services in schools 
•	National Assessment Program – Literacy 
and Numeracy (NAPLAN) participation 
and reporting
•	Qualifications and competencies of 
Educational Interpreters and Teachers of 
the Deaf.
Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   18 
Quality of bilingual programs and 
support services in schools 
As with Early Intervention, access to 
School programs which offer Auslan is 
a pressing issue for the deaf community 
and families of deaf children. Even 
when bilingual programs are available, 
the question still begs whether or not 
they are really working or indeed truly 
bilingual. In short, are they succeeding? 
The challenges concerning the quality of 
bilingual education directly relate to the 
skill development and qualifications of 
teachers, as well as to the limited access 
to additional professional development 
for those educators. Although Auslan is 
included in the national curriculum as a 
LOTE, there is concern surrounding the 
linguistic understanding of some teachers 
delivering the courses. 
In terms of the quality of support services 
in mainstream classrooms for deaf and hard 
of hearing children, of particular concern 
is the isolated format in which many 
students receive their assistance. Often 
the hearing impaired student is separated 
from the other students in the classroom to 
work one on one with a teacher or support 
worker, which potentially isolates them 
socially from their classmates. 
Peripheral issues related to the quality of 
support services within schools include 
limited access to captioning, interpreting 
and deaf role models. Amanda’s Story
 
Amanda is a mother of three 
children, two of which are hearing 
and one of which is deaf. She is on 
the management committee of the 
Parents of Deaf Children (NSW) and is 
a strong advocate for the promotion 
of bilingual education. 
Her daughter first went down the 
path of oral education and only after 
that failed did she then change to 
signing. This was when her child 
was about three years old, and 
Amanda believes that this gave her 
a significant disadvantage in terms 
of her educational development.  
This happened because Amanda 
was forced to choose one method 
of Early Intervention language for 
her daughter over the other right 
from the beginning, rather being 
able to explore different modes of 
communication. Amanda’s story, 
like many others, involved a lack of 
information at the time of diagnosis. 
She argues that parents need more 
support than just being given a 
book, and told to go off and decide. 
She suggests a team or person to 
contact the parents who can offer non 
biased information. Parents should be 
presented with all options, and have 
the ability to meet people from deaf 
community and doctors so that they 
can make an informed choice, not 
forced one way or the other. 
Now she wants educators and policy 
makers to become aware of this issue 
and hear the parents’ perspective and 
to understand that hearing impaired 
children need as much exposure to 
all different types of language so that 
they can absorb as much as they can. 
This, she argues, is the key to driving 
successful educational outcomes.NAPLAN participation and reporting
A widely debated initiative, which was 
implemented across Australian schools 
in 2008, is NAPLAN testing. An annual 
assessment for all students in Years 3, 5, 7 
and 9, the scheme tests the types of skills 
that are essential for every child to progress 
through school and life, in reading, writing, 
spelling, grammar and punctuation, and 
numeracy12.
NAPLAN evaluates individual students in 
comparison to their peers nation-wide, and 
reports on aggregated results of schools as 
whole. COAG determined that the public 
should be provided with information on 
each school in Australia and it was agreed 
at COAG’s 24th meeting held on 29 
November 2008 that, “For the purpose of 
providing public information about schools, 
a common national website should be 
used to provide parents/caregivers and the 
public with access to rich information about 
individual schools.(viii)13. As a result, the 
website My School was established to publish 
all schools’” NAPLAN scores.
The NAPLAN participation rate of deaf 
and hard of hearing children has historically 
been low, due predominately to two factors. 
The first is that minimal support, such as 
an interpreter, is provided to the student 
to assist them when taking the exam. The 
second is that schools often deter deaf 
students from participating if they believe 
that the student will achieve sub-standard 
results. This is because their participation will 
then ultimately drag down the average score 
of the school, making it appear less attractive 
on the My Schools website. The flipside 
of this is that NAPLAN scores also have 
funding implications. If deaf and hard of 
hearing students do not participate then their 
need for extra service (and extra funding) will 
not be identified.

19  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children

Assessment of these children under the same 
program as their hearing peers provides a 
great opportunity for parents to understand 
how those students are progressing, and to 
identify gaps in their learning which need to 
be improved upon to enable them to catch 
up with the rest of the class. It is important 
that deaf children participate in NAPLAN 
so that more data can be gained on the 
educational needs and progress of these 
students. It is this evidence that can then be 
utilised to drive change. 
The challenge for deaf and hard of hearing 
children and NAPLAN testing is twofold: 
finding a way to determine how to 
support these children in their NAPLAN 
participation, and reforming the reporting 
conventions so that schools are not 
disadvantaged by encouraging their deaf 
students to be involved.  
Qualifications and competencies of 
educational interpreters and teachers 
of the deaf
It is no great mystery that a student’s 
learning is directly affected by the standard 
of their teacher. After all, one cannot learn 
chemistry if their science teacher does not 
understand the periodic table, nor calculus 
if their teacher does not understand basic 
mathematics, and with good reason an 
educator without such skills would not be 
allowed to teach such subjects in our schools. For deaf and hard of hearing children, 
however, the educators that are there to 
accommodate their needs are often under 
qualified and lacking in critical competencies. 
Prior to delving into the challenges that this 
brings to deaf and hard of hearing children, 
the difference between roles of educational 
interpreters and teachers of the deaf should 
be clarified. Educational interpreters in the 
classroom situation are there to facilitate 
communication between the deaf student, the 
teacher and other students, with the aim of 
fostering independence and participation in 
the deaf student. They are usually positioned 
at the front of the classroom and aim to 
convey the exact meaning of what the teacher 
is expressing. teachers of the deaf, on the 
other hand, provide academic support on an 
individual or small group basis either within 
or external to the classroom. They also liaise 
with the class teacher to provide guidance, 
information and resources to ensure that 
the needs of students are being catered for 
appropriately. 
Both interpreters and teachers of the deaf 
can gain accreditation to demonstrate their 
skill level. The National Accreditation 
Authority for T ranslators and Interpreters 
Ltd (NAATI) is Australia’s only national 
standards and accreditation body for 
educational interpreters. Its primary purpose 
is to strengthen inclusion and participation in 
Australian society by assisting in meeting its 
diverse and changing communication needs 
and expectations14. Although NAATI claims that its 
credentialing provides quality assurance of 
translators and interpreters, the NAATI 
certification levels have been criticised for 
being much lower than the international 
standard, for example, NAATI Level 
4 certification has similar criteria to 
international Level 2 standards. The 
corresponding association for teachers of 
the deaf is the National Association of 
Australian Teachers of the Deaf (NAATD). 
With over 77 years as a professional 
association, NAATD currently represents 
over 300 teachers of the deaf, spanning 
those who work in Early Intervention, to 
primary school, high school and specialist 
schools. One of the aims of NAATD is 
to establish national competencies, which 
define eligibility for membership. These 
competencies fall into four categories:  
1Curriculum, teaching and learning
2Communication
3Educational audiology
4Awareness of the range of provision of 
educational support
These standards are set to be adopted in 
2013, with the aim of being incorporated 
into the National Teaching Standards, 
although as they are they apply only to 
teachers of the deaf, not to others in the 
industry such as Educational Interpreters.
So what a lot of [substandard] educational interpreting 
potentially does is mask problems. It sets up the 
illusion of inclusion that actually doesn’t exist.

Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   20 

Universal to educational interpreters and 
teachers of the deaf are challenges concerning 
quality of service, and this has been traced to 
common themes of lack of workforce supply 
and inadequate training programs. 
The challenge of attracting new educational 
interpreters and teachers of the deaf is 
linked to a lack of incentive in the system. 
Remuneration is poor, and in many States 
there is no clearly defined career path for 
these professionals. There is also often 
lack of clarity with regards to position 
descriptions, and the role boundaries of an 
educational interpreter or teacher of the 
deaf can be extended beyond appropriate 
limits. As a result, professionals in this area 
end up carrying out other ancillary roles 
such as counselling, consulting and career 
development which are beyond the scope 
of their expertise. Furthermore, there are 
major discrepancies across the nation relating 
to employment conditions. How these 
professionals are recruited, hired, terminated, 
and their status within the school varies from 
state to state.  A Better Practice model for 
deaf educators and interpreters 
in Western Australia
There are systems and structures 
in Western Australia that do not 
exist in other States and territories. 
The combination of systemic 
knowledge, levels of authority and 
well-established credentials have 
created well rewarded career paths 
for educational interpreters. Small 
allowances are awarded for taking 
up professional development within 
the first three years of practice, 
and there is a clearly stepped 
progression path for teachers from 
entry level through to principal, 
however there are also different 
pay increases for remaining within 
the classroom, so educators do not 
have to turn into administrators to 
be better remunerated.
Deaf educators in Western Australia 
also have Duties Other Than 
Teaching (DOTT) and Duties Other 
Than Interpreting (DOTI) time for 
which they are paid, so that they 
can thoroughly prepare for classes 
and correct students’ work. 
All of these characteristics amount 
to deaf education being treated 
as a profession rather than an 
occupation in Western Australia.The shortage of skilled deaf educators 
is caused by a lack of standardisation of 
skill sets and competencies. There are 
only 157 Level Three NAATI accredited 
educational interpreters throughout the 
whole of Australia, whereas there are about 
722 para- professionals, meaning that the 
field is very bottom heavy and top narrow. 
A consequence of this is that the more 
experienced and skilled people are very few 
in number and unwilling to work in a school 
for a very small sum of money when they are 
in high demand in other places. 
Although NAATD has established some 
guidelines for standards for teachers of the 
deaf, these are yet to be enforced. Yet the 
factor creating the most significant negative 
impact on quality for this cohort is that the 
training program to become a teacher of the 
deaf is only one year in duration. Institutions 
such as the Renwick Centre have had to 
reduce the course from 18 months, with 
many core subjects now only offered online. 
This is a very ambitious timeframe in which 
to cover all the key competencies necessary 
to be a deaf educator, as identified from 
NAATD standards.  Community Challenges – School Education

Bringing it all together
In this chapter, the paper shifts from the 
describing the issues that affect deaf and 
hard of hearing children and their families to 
proposing pragmatic steps that Deaf Australia 
can take to help overcome these challenges. 
The summit enabled members of the Deaf 
community, parents and others in the deaf 
sector to voice their concerns and to do 
justice to these voices we have developed a 
multi-phase strategy to facilitate the change 
necessary to ensure that Australia’s deaf and 
hard of hearing children are given the care 
and support they need in order to reach their 
full potential.  
The proposed strategy is underpinned by the 
principles within Deaf Australia’s vision for 
2020. At its core, the vision is founded on the 
cornerstones of equal opportunity for deaf 
people. Although each principle of the vision 
is inclusive of all demographic groups within 
in the deaf community, statements 2,3,4,6, 
7 and 8 are of particular relevance to Early 
Intervention and school education of deaf 
and hard of hearing children. Deaf Australia’s vision for 202015 is that deaf people will have made significant 
advancements to equality and quality of life through:
1Full human rights, self-determination and political strength
2Full access to communication, language, information
3Quality education, educators who are Deaf and who are proficient Auslan users, access to 
universities and life-long learning programs
4Full respect for and widespread use of Auslan by non-deaf people
5Diverse employment, including, for example, teaching, administration, medicine, psychology, 
business, law and politics
6Full interaction through provision of qualified interpreters and information technologies
7Full partnerships with families, educators, health providers, bio-ethicists and policy-makers. 
“Nothing about us without us” will have become the standard
8Auslan is recognised and linguistic rights are realised in practice.
The design of the approach going forward has been guided by a combination of these vision 
2020 principles and the challenges as raised in earlier chapters. Mutually beneficial relation
It takes a village to raise a child and that’s what 
we have here. We have a village. It includes the 
family, the deaf and hard of hearing children, 
the teachers of the deaf, the services providers. 
We are all part of that village and we are here 
to improve the education for those children.

A call to action
There is no “quick-fix” solution for 
the problems noted. Arriving at better, 
sustainable outcomes for Australia’s deaf and 
hard of hearing children is an achievement 
that will take a significant amount of time 
to be realised. The path to solutions with 
real benefits will involve the cooperation of 
multiple stakeholders, through coordinated 
lobbying for policy reforms and systemic 
collaboration to improve information and 
services. To make the entire process more 
manageable, the structure of the proposed 
strategy has been designed in stages, 
wherein each phase builds upon the work 
of the preceding one. A high level view of 
overarching strategy is as follows.
A key factor for successful lobbying is 
achieving a critical mass of supporting 
voices. To ensure that an issue becomes 
impossible for politicians to ignore, it needs 
to be demonstrated that a significant portion 
of the community is dissatisfied with the 
current state of affairs and demanding 
change. When established and reputable 
organisations align to lobby an issue, this 
promotion of unity within diversity to 
present one voice is stronger than many 
fragmented protests when lobbying for 
things going forward. The initial step for 1. Collaboration 2. Advocacy 3. Influence
•	Initiate partnerships with 
key organisations already 
engaged with the deaf 
community.
•	Develop an engagement 
model/ plan for these 
partnerships.  The aim of 
the collaborations will be 
to advocate for positions 
aligned to Deaf Australia’s 
‘Vision 2020’ statement.
•	Strive for additional 
funding from DEEWR 
for a policy officer to 
focus on education (and 
employment) issues for 
deaf people.•	Develop minimum 
standards for Teachers of 
the Deaf and interpreters.
•	Publish position papers as 
a basis for advocacy on 
issues related to:
- NAPLAN participation 
and reporting
- Increased family support
•	Establish a parent advisory 
group, addressing:
- logistics
- terms of reference•	Present data driven, 
evidence-based papers 
to government in order to 
lobby for priority issues.
•	Utilise partnerships to 
develop comprehensive, 
updated information 
for new parents of deaf 
children, i.e. “Choices 2.0”.
•	Engage with government 
leaders in education
- Establish a line of 
communication between 
government and the 
Deaf community
- Strive for national 
advocacy funding 
(individual and systemic)
Deaf Australia, therefore, to maximise the 
benefit from all subsequent actions, is to form 
strategic partnerships with other organisations 
that are already engaged with the Deaf 
community. Despite the fact that each group 
has its own focus, such as Deaf Australia’s 
strong advocacy for the promotion of Auslan, 
there is also much common ground on which 
organisations can collaborate. 
To leverage the benefit of these partnerships, 
a structured approach to collaboration should 
be adopted rather than ad-hoc arrangements. 
To achieve this end, Deaf Australia and 
the relevant partners should develop an 
engagement model at the inception of 
their alliance. The engagement model will 
shape how to share a vision, build trust 
and structures to enable consultation and 
collaborate to achieve improvements for the 
communities they serve.
A key outcome of this first phase could be 
additional funding from Department of 
Education Employment and Workplace 
Relations for a policy officer. This person 
would collaborate with the partnership, and 
be responsible for focusing on education 
issues affecting the deaf community. This phase involves the transition from 
foundation work to pragmatic action. 
According to the challenges raised, three key 
initiatives have been prioritised to champion 
this stage of the strategy. They are to: 
•	Develop minimum standards for 
professionals who provide support services 
for hearing impaired children, including 
both teachers of the deaf and educational 
interpreters, 
•	Publish position papers, and 
•	Establish a parent advisory group.
Minimum standards
Minimum standards are important for 
quality control. In partnership with other 
organisations, if Deaf Australia could present a 
solid case to government stating, “we advocate 
for minimum standards for educational 
interpreters and we believe those standards 
should include x, y and z” then this would 
pave the way for reform. The discussion on 
standards of education should involve quality 
indicators about what defines good outcomes, 
promote inclusive practice for all students, 
and determine the minimal qualifications 
required for teaching or interpreting with 
clearly established benchmarks.

Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children   24 

This informed, systemic advocacy could also 
be complemented by individual advocacy 
for deaf and hard of hearing children who 
are being disadvantaged by the quality of 
support that they are receiving. As noted in 
earlier chapters, NAATD has already made 
some progress with regards to defining 
minimum standards for teachers of the 
deaf, which is a great lead for the industry, 
yet these are yet to be implemented and 
incorporated into National Teaching 
Standards. 
Position papers
Publishing position papers is a powerful 
advocacy tool. Deaf Australia is already 
experienced in the production of these 
documents, as can be seen in examples 
such as the organisation’s policy papers 
campaigning for Auslan education options 
and improved Early Intervention services. To 
leverage this strength, Deaf Australia should 
continue to produce insightful position 
papers, with the first two topics being:
•	Issues related to NAPLAN participation 
and reporting
•	Increased support for the families of deaf 
and hard of hearing children. 
Overwhelming response from the 
participants at the summit was that deaf 
and hard of hearing students should be 
assessed against the same standards as hearing 
children. This helps the government to 
understand a school’s funding needs and at 
the same time enables parents to understand 
in what areas their child needs to improve. To 
combat the problem of schools discouraging 
deaf and hard of hearing students from 
participating in NAPLAN, Deaf Australia 
should publish a position paper suggesting 
reform on the way NAPLAN is reported. 
Either hearing impaired students’ scores 
could be excluded from schools’ aggregate 
scores or extra information could be added 
to indicate the number of hearing impaired 
students at the school to qualify the results. Current NAPLAN reporting already does 
this for identifying indigenous Australian 
participants. The recommendation has a high 
probability of achieving successful outcomes 
because it does not require any extra funds 
from government, but rather a simple change 
in procedure. 
The other so-called “low hanging fruit” in 
terms of position paper topics would be 
for Deaf Australia to publish calling for 
increased support for the families of hearing 
impaired children. Whilst there is some level 
of systemic advocacy, it was identified in the 
Summit that there is very little in terms of 
individual advocacy for parents to navigate 
the system. Cross sector collaboration, 
as proposed in phase one, would help to 
decrease the gap in parents’ knowledge of 
what is available in terms of support, and 
what their rights are under the Disability 
Discrimination Act. 
Parent advisory group
The final component of phase two relates 
less to advocacy and more to availability 
of information. This suggestion involves 
establishing a parent advisory group. There 
are already parent support groups that 
allow members of the community to share 
information and tips and gain support from 
one another outside of an institutional 
framework. Aussie Deaf Kids also has an 
online platform. To maximise the benefit of 
these parent groups, Deaf Australia could 
establish an expert parent group that advises 
Deaf Australia on its advocacy work. 
This final stage of the strategic plan involves 
striving for long-term change backed 
by credible research. The three major 
components of this include:
•	Submitting data-driven research papers 
to government for lobbying purposes
•	Developing an updated, comprehensive 
information booklet, i.e. Choices 2.0 •	Engaging with the government leaders in 
education to strive for national advocacy 
funding, both individually for parents and 
on a systemic level in the education area. 
The difference between the position papers 
of phase two and the research papers of phase 
three is the amount of investigation that is 
undertaken to support the arguments being 
put forth. The type of paper in this section 
will be calling for fundamental changes to 
the sector, and if that change requires capital 
injection on behalf of the government then 
there needs to be a substantial body of 
evidence to justify this funding.
A key criticism raised by parents at the summit 
was that the official booklet given to parents at 
the time of their child’s diagnosis, which aims 
to outline all of the choices available for Early 
Intervention and education, in reality neglects 
to present all options equally and without 
bias. To address this problem, Deaf Australia, 
in collaboration with other advocacy groups 
and service providers, should aim to develop a 
revised version of the Choices booklet, which 
is more comprehensive and accessible. This 
could be supplemented by a range of other 
materials in different forms such as videos, 
available via links on the Deaf Australia 
website. 
Finally, to increase Deaf Australia’s political 
voracity, the organisation should aim to 
establish a line of communication between 
the deaf community and the key leaders 
in education. This relationship has not 
historically existed, however it is illogical for 
those making the decisions relating to the 
education of deaf and hard of hearing children 
to be out of touch with those who need the 
service. Deaf Australia is well positioned 
to provide an appropriate channel of 
communication. A key measure of success for 
this connection would be the establishment of 
funding for national advocacy to help support 
the pursuit of further change. 3. InfluenceDeaf Australia’s Response – A strategy for better outcomes
25  Early Intervention & Education for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children
Challenges pertaining to Early Intervention and education of deaf and 
hard of hearing children, as raised at the Summit and reiterated in this 
document, are numerous and complex. The issues explored are also 
by no means exhaustive. Many other factors, such as the advancement 
of technology and one’s mental health also play an important role in a 
child’s outcomes. These, however, fell beyond the scope of the Summit, 
and should be addressed in future continuations of this conversation. 
It is also important that we do not get weighed down by the challenges. 
Instead, we must take the next step and develop solutions to the 
problems. By moving forward and creating a positive future for deaf 
and hard of hearing children, we will enable them, as valued members 
of our community, to reach their utmost potential. This is the 
opportunity that every Australian child deserves.
