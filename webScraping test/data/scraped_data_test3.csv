Describing hearing loss | Aussie Deaf Kids,"Skip to content Describing hearing loss You are here: Home » Resources » Your child’s hearing » Hearing loss » Describing hearing loss Explore this section The following questions help to identify the different types of hearing loss: When did the hearing loss occur (from birth or after)? What type of hearing loss is it (permanent or conductive)? How severe is the hearing loss? Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies? Is there a hearing loss in both ears? Is the hearing loss the same in both ears? Is the hearing loss stable over time (has the audiogram changed)? When did the hearing loss occur? Any hearing loss that is present at birth or soon after is referred to as congenital . Hearing loss which occurs later in life is referred to as acquired . The earlier a hearing loss occurs, the more significant its impact will be. Children who are born with a hearing loss have limited access to the sounds around them (including speech) from the very beginning. Hearing loss that occurs before a child develops speech and language skills is referred to as prelingual . Hearing loss that occurs after a child develops speech and language skills is known as postlingual . The effects of a prelingual hearing loss are usually much more significant than a postlingual hearing loss. The challenge faced by a young child with a prelingual hearing loss is to develop normal spoken language skills. The challenge faced by a child with a postlingual hearing loss is to learn to manage their hearing loss in order to minimise its impact on their daily life. What type of hearing loss is it? When a hearing loss occurs because the sound cannot travel freely down the outer ear and through the middle ear, it is referred to as a conductive hearing loss. A child with a middle ear infection may have a conductive hearing loss. If the conductive hearing loss is a result of illness or infection, then it is not permanent. Hearing loss which is caused by the sound not being converted into electrical signals within the inner ear, or not being transmitted along the auditory nerve to the brain is referred to as sensorineural hearing loss. This hearing loss is permanent. Some children experience both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, and this is referred to as a mixed hearing loss. How severe is the hearing loss? When hearing loss is measured, it will be described as mild, moderate, severe, profound or a combination of these. For example, if someone has a moderate hearing loss in the low frequencies and a profound hearing loss in the high frequencies, this hearing loss would be described as moderate to profound . Is the hearing loss similar across all frequencies? When a hearing loss is plotted on an audiogram, it may appear flat , i.e. the hearing loss is much the same across the frequencies (seen on the diagram below), or it may be sloping , e.g. the hearing loss is much more severe in the higher frequencies than it is in the lower frequencies. Flat hearing losses are usually much easier to fit with a hearing aid. Sloping hearing losses may mean that children will miss a lot of the high frequency sounds such as ‘s’ and ‘sh’ and they are often more difficult to fit with a hearing aid. Is there a hearing loss in both ears? When there is a hearing loss in both ears, this is referred to as bilateral hearing loss. If hearing is normal in one ear, but there is a hearing loss in the other ear, this is referred to as unilateral hearing loss. Children with a unilateral hearing loss may have difficulty hearing well in noisy conditions and may have difficulty locating where sound is coming from. Teachers should make sure that children with a unilateral hearing loss always sit with their ‘good ear’ closer to the speaker. Is the hearing loss the same in both ears? When the hearing loss is very similar in both ears, this is referred to as a symmetrical loss. If the hearing loss is different in each ear, this is referred to as an asymmetrical loss. If the loss is very different in each ear, the child may experience difficulties similar to those associated with unilateral loss. Sometimes only the ‘better ear’ will be fitted with a hearing aid. Is the hearing loss stable over time? Hearing loss does not always remain the same over time. Some hearing losses, particularly conductive, may go up and down frequently. This is referred to as a fluctuating hearing loss. Children with fluctuating conductive hearing loss may develop very poor listening skills. Some hearing losses may get worse over time. This is referred to as a deteriorating hearing loss. Children with a deteriorating hearing loss may show a decline in their speech and listening skills over time. back to top For more information: Describing the severity of the hearing loss Unilateral hearing loss Last updated: 27th Sep, 2024 Disclaimer: The information contained on this website is not intended as a substitute for independent professional advice.

Mild hearing loss Moderate hearing loss Severe hearing loss Profound hearing loss Mild Hearing Loss (21–40dB) A child with a mild hearing loss may have difficulty hearing soft or distant speech. They may also have difficulty hearing normal conversation in situations where there is a lot of background noise. To experience a mild hearing loss, try wearing earplugs or blocking your ears with your fingers. You can still hear people talking but it sounds muffled. It is even more difficult to understand the conversation if there is any background noise. Many children with mild hearing loss do not wear hearing aids. As the loss gets closer to 40dB some children may be fitted with a hearing aid. How will this impact on learning? A child with a mild hearing loss will not usually have difficulties related to their hearing loss in school unless they are in very noisy environments. For more information Babies with a possible mild hearing loss Your baby has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step? Your child has a mild hearing loss – What’s the next step? Management of a child with a permanent unaided hearing loss Moderate Hearing Loss (41-70dB) A child with a moderate hearing loss will need to wear hearing aids to understand normal speech. Without hearing aids, the child will need to rely on speech reading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time. Hearing aids make all sounds louder for the child, including background noise. Hearing aids work most effectively in quiet environments. How will this impact on learning? A child with a moderate hearing loss may: not hear important elements of a class discussion including key context and content without visual cues have a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peers not hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writing have problems pronouncing some speech sounds become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environments misinterpret what is said although they ‘hear’ the speaker (they know that someone said something but couldn’t hear clearly enough to understand what was said). Severe hearing loss (71 – 90dB) A child with a severe loss will have difficulty understanding normal speech even when wearing their hearing aids. They would not detect normal conversation without their hearing aid but may hear loud voices at close distances (up to one metre). It is important to remember that hearing aids make sounds louder for the child which assists with comprehension but they do not restore normal hearing. Even with hearing aids, a child with a severe hearing loss will need to rely on speechreading cues. The level of concentration required to speechread is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time. Children with a severe hearing loss may be fitted with a cochlear implant. They will be able to access all speech sounds through the implant, but will have difficulty understanding speech if they are not wearing it. How will this impact on learning? A child with a severe hearing loss may: not hear important elements of the class discussion including key context and content without visual cues have a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peers not hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writing have problems pronouncing some speech sounds, particularly those in the high frequency such as ‘s’ or ‘p’ become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environments misinterpret what is said although they ‘hear’ the speaker’s voice (they know that someone said something but couldn’t hear clearly enough to understand what was said) have a limited understanding of colloquial language, such as ‘pull up your socks’ have difficulty understanding complex sentences have poor vocal quality have trouble explaining their ideas to other people have limited background knowledge and experiences in a range of areas which can affect learning and social skills. Profound Hearing Loss (91dB+) A child with a profound hearing loss will always have trouble understanding conversational speech even with their hearing aids, and would not detect even the loudest components of shouting unaided (without their hearing aid). Many students with profound hearing loss find traditional hearing aids of limited benefit. The majority of children with a profound hearing loss have cochlear implants. Children with a profound hearing loss exhibit a wide range of communication skills. Some children develop listening and spoken language as their main means of communication. Other students may need, or prefer, to rely on manual communication skills such as signing. How will this impact on learning? A child with a profound hearing loss may: not hear important elements of the class discussion including key context and content without visual cues have a smaller or more limited vocabulary than their same age peers not hear all the sounds in a word, commonly leaving off ‘s’, ‘ing’ and ‘ed’ in their speech and their writing have problems pronouncing some speech sounds, particularly those in the high frequency such as ‘s’ or ‘p’ become very tired towards the end of sessions that have required intense concentration or were conducted in noisy environments misinterpret what is said have difficulty with some reading materials have a limited understanding of colloquial language, such as ‘pull up your socks’ have difficulty understanding complex sentences use a limited range of sentence structures and therefore use the same sentence structure repetitively (e.g. subject, verb, object) have trouble explaining their ideas to other people have limited background knowledge and experiences in a range of areas which can affect learning and social skills have poor vocal quality rely on signed communication. back to top Last updated: 27th Sep, 2024 Disclaimer: The information contained on this website is not intended as a substitute for independent professional advice.

What do hearing aids do? | Aussie Deaf Kids,"Skip to content What do hearing aids do? You are here: Home » Resources » Your child’s hearing » Hearing aids » What do hearing aids do? Explore this section It is a common belief that people with hearing loss just can’t hear sounds loudly enough, but the problem is much more complicated than that. Four main problems caused by hearing loss How do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss? Four main problems caused by hearing loss People with a hearing loss don’t hear soft sounds. Consequently, the softer speech sounds, which are usually the consonants, may simply not be heard. For example, the sequence of vowel sounds “i-e-a-ar” may have belonged to “pick the black harp” but could be heard by a hearing-impaired person as “kick the cat hard”. To overcome this difficulty, a hearing aid has to provide amplification to make these soft sounds loud enough to be heard. Key parts of particular speech sounds, such as the high frequency parts, might not be audible. To overcome this problem a hearing aid has to provide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and where speech has the weakest sounds. A hearing-impaired ear has difficulty separating sounds. When we are listening to a sound in noise, such as a person speaking at a party, the normal ear will send a message to the brain that two separate bundles of sound are coming through. The brain, by using other information available, such as context and direction of the sound, may then be able to ignore the unwanted noise and make good use of the speech. The impaired ear however is much less efficient at this task. Also, once speech and noise get mixed together inside a hearing aid, there is no way the hearing aid can separate the two to compensate. Directional microphones can help prevent the sound and noise from getting mixed together before they are passed to the amplifier. In a normal ear, a wide range of environmental sounds can fit between the softest sound that can be heard and the loudest sound that can be comfortably tolerated. In a hearing-impaired ear this ‘dynamic’ range is greatly reduced; ie. soft sound becomes inaudible and loud sound becomes uncomfortable and sometimes painfully loud. If a hearing aid makes all sounds louder so that the hearing-impaired person can hear the softest sounds then most of the loud sounds may be far too loud. So a hearing aid must give more amplification to a soft sound than it does to a louder sound. This squashing of sounds into the reduced range of an impaired ear is called “compression”. So a hearing aid has a big task. It must: Make sounds louder but not make loud sounds uncomfortably loud Provide more amplification for frequencies where hearing loss is the greatest and speech sounds are the weakest Try to keep unwanted sounds, such a background noise, out of the signal provided to the wearer back to top How do hearing aids work and compensate for the effects of a hearing loss? Hearing aids amplify sounds so they are loud enough to be heard. A hearing aid also amplifies some frequencies more than others to allow for the characteristics of hearing loss and speech. The audiologist will set the hearing aid to make sure its output never exceeds a predetermined upper limit, so that sounds do not become uncomfortably loud. Peak Clipping Versus Compression The hearing aid limits loud sounds by either clipping off the peaks of the sounds (peak clipping) or by squashing or compressing them into a softer signal (compression). Both result in some distortion and loss of detail, but the distortion is less noticeable for compression than for peak clipping. In general, compression provides a clearer signal for speech in quiet, better listening situations, comfort for loud sounds, and less need for volume control adjustment. Research has shown that most people with hearing loss, except some of those with profound hearing losses, prefer compression output limiting. This is why Hearing Australia has had compression as a feature in its hearing aids since 1986. There are many new types of hearing aids now becoming available that use complex forms of compression, all with the aim of maximizing clarity and filling the impaired dynamic range with audible and comfortable sound. Hearing Australia’s standard hearing aids have many independently adjusted compressors which interact to provide controlled and comfortable loudness. This means that compression can be set to suit the individual needs of each child. back to top Related articles: How do audiologists select hearing aids?

hearing loss

2 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024MAINTAINING GOOD EAR HEALTH
Your baby can hear with one ear—an important asset to protect. However, three 
key factors might affect their hearing during their life.
Ear wax
The ear naturally produces wax (or cerumen) to protect the ear canal. Typically, 
the ears clean themselves. The wax and dirt move away from the eardrum to the 
opening of the ear canal, where you can remove the wax with a damp cloth. 
However, sometimes wax builds up and blocks sound from reaching the 
eardrum. This can make it harder for your child with UHL to hear well. A wax 
build-up in young children is usually only noticed during routine ear 
examinations at the doctor or audiologist.
Ear drops that soften the wax are available from the pharmacy, which may be all 
that is needed to remove the wax. Always consult your family doctor (GP) if 
you’re concerned. 
Do not insert any foreign objects into the ear canal!
Avoid using ear candling which is both ineffective 
and dangerous.
Ear infections
Ear infections are common in young children and can cause temporary hearing 
loss and impact on speech development and learning.
Ear infections can occur in the outer ear (otitis externa) or the middle ear (otitis 
media). Outer ear infections are usually painful and may cause fever. In contrast, 
middle ear infections can lead to fluid build-up behind the eardrum, affecting the 
child's hearing.  
Otitis media with effusion or 'glue ear' occurs when fluid remains trapped behind 
the eardrum. A child with glue ear may have no symptoms, but the doctor can 
see the fluid during an ear examination. If the fluid remains in the middle ear for 
a long time or returns frequently, it can affect hearing.
Sound Waves | 3
Preventing ear infections
You can reduce your child's risk of ear infections.
• Immunise against pneumococcal disease. Pneumococcal infections are a  
 major cause of otitis media. Vaccination for pneumococcal disease is part  
 of the routine immunisation schedule for babies at 2, 4 and 12 months old  
 (3 doses total) and is free for all Australian children.
• Practice good hand hygiene to prevent the spread of the germs that cause  
 colds and flu.
• Avoid exposing your child to cigarette smoke, as it increases the risk of ear  
 infections15.
Treating ear infections
Mild infections can often be managed with pain relievers like paracetamol. 
However, consult your family doctor if your child has a high fever, severe earache, 
or persistent ear discharge.
If you are worried about your child's hearing, arrange an appointment with your 
family doctor. Your doctor will examine your child's ears and should be able to 
tell if glue ear is present. If there is any pain or sign of infection, your GP may 
prescribe antibiotics. Your GP may want to wait to see if the glue ear clears up by 
itself before referring your child to an ENT specialist. 
4 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Noise
Noise-induced hearing loss is becoming more common, especially due to loud 
leisure activities. It's important to understand that the effect of noise on hearing 
is cumulative - factors like frequency of exposure, duration, and intensity can 
cause damage over time. 
Protecting you and your child from noise
Lead by example! Children learn from observing their parents, so you should 
always use safe listening practices. 
• Educate your child from the early years on the importance of ear   
 protection.
• Always wear hearing protectors when carrying out noisy tasks at home and  
 help to develop good habits in your children from a young age.
• Turn down the volume when listening to music in a confined space.
• Turn down the volume on personal stereo headsets. Smartphones let you  
 set a safe listening limit in settings. The volume of a personal headsets  
 should be at a level where you can still hear someone speaking to you an  
 arm's length away. 
• Using noise-cancelling headphones can help eliminate external   
 background noise and allow the MP3 player to be played at lower volume.
Sound Waves | 5ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN 
WITH UNILATERAL HEARING LOSS TO 
HEAR MORE EFFECTIVELY
Children with UHL often develop and use various adaptive strategies to enhance 
their hearing and communication abilities. These strategies help them cope with 
the challenges of having reduced hearing in one ear and make the most of their 
available hearing. You can support your child with UHL to develop these 
adaptive strategies from the outset through modelling the behaviours when 
interacting with your child.
Optimal seating and positioning
Car trips: Placing your child’s car seat so their affected ear is alongside the 
window will help them hear the other people in the car with their good ear.
Social interactions: When interacting with peers or in group settings, 
children can place themselves so their good ear is closest to the person 
speaking.
Dinner time: Sitting with their good ear towards the other people at the 
dinner table can help your child enjoy family conversations during meals.
Classroom seating:  Sitting in the front of the classroom and positioning 
their good ear towards the teacher can help your child with UHL hear instructions 
more clearly.
Visual cues and lip reading
Face the speaker: Encouraging others to face your child while speaking to 
them allows them to use visual cues and lip-reading for better understanding of 
speech.
Clear line of sight:  Being able to clearly see the speaker helps your child 
pick up other visual information that adds to what they hear and improves 
understanding.
6 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Environmental modifications
Reduce background noise: Minimising background noise at home and in 
school settings, such as turning off unnecessary electronic devices, can improve 
their ability to focus on important sounds.
Acoustic treatments: Using carpets, curtains, and soft furnishings can 
reduce echo and reverberation, making speech easier to hear and understand.
Communication Strategies
Clarification Requests : Teaching your child to ask for repetition or 
clarification if they miss something can help ensure they understand the 
conversation.
By employing these adaptive strategies, you can assist your child with UHL and 
their ability to hear and understand spoken language. These strategies not only 
enhance their communication skills but also support their academic and social 
development.
Sound Waves | 7CREATING A LANGUAGE-RICH HOME 
ENVIRONMENT
Children learn best through everyday activities and interactions within their 
natural environments. By weaving language into daily routines like playtime, 
mealtime, and family outings, families can support their child's speech and 
language development. In a language-rich environment, children are surrounded 
by words and conversations, giving them numerous opportunities to hear and 
use language. 
Families play a crucial role in creating a home environment that is rich in 
language experiences. By engaging in meaningful conversations with your child, 
reading to them daily, singing songs, and playing language-based games, you 
are providing a rich language environment. By describing daily activities, asking 
open-ended questions, and encouraging your child to express their thoughts 
and feelings, you can create a home environment that nurtures your child’s 
vocabulary growth, comprehension skills, and overall communication abilities. 
In today's digital age, it is important to limit children's screen time. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children under age 5 spend one 
hour or less on digital devices each day, and that those under age 1 should have 
no screen time at all. While certain digital tools can help the process of 
introducing children to new vocabulary, concepts, and stories, they shouldn’t 
take the place of direct human interaction, which is the most effective way for 
children to learn language.
8 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024CREATING A GOOD LISTENING 
ENVIRONMENT 
You already know how important it is to fill your child’s life with language. You 
want your child with UHL to hear all the songs you sing, the stories you share and 
the snippets of conversations that make up your family life. There are a few steps 
you can take to create an environment at home that will make it easier for your 
child to hear and listen.
The three main barriers to understanding speech for anyone with a hearing loss 
are: 
Distance from the sound 
Background noise 
Reverberation
Distance from the sound
Loudness, pitch, and distance from sound are all important in our ability to hear. 
Children with hearing loss have a reduced hearing range. Your child may have 
difficulty understanding what you are saying when you are talking from a 
distance.
Fortunately, we communicate with young babies at close range – they are usually 
only an arm’s length away as we cuddle, play and attend to their needs.
You do need to be aware of the impact of distance on your growing child’s 
listening ability. When you call from the next room for your child to put away the 
toys and they do not do it, they may not have heard your request. This is one of 
the dilemmas of being the parent of a child with hearing loss – have they not 
done it because they couldn’t hear you properly, or are they being disobedient?
Background noise
We all know the experience of trying to make out what someone is saying to us 
in a bar or a rock concert. We know the person is talking to us, and we can 
probably catch a few words and get the gist of the conversation. We probably 
know something about the topic and can use our knowledge and experience to 
understand what they are saying. And we are hearing with two ears.
Sound Waves | 9
Background noise is a problem for all children and anyone with hearing loss. 
Young children are unable to ‘predict from context.’ They have limited 
vocabulary and experience and can’t fill in the missing pieces of conversation as 
adults can. For children with typical hearing, their ability to understand sentences 
in noisy environments does improve through the early childhood years. They 
reach adult levels of speech understanding in noise in their teens. Children and 
adults with hearing loss will always find background noise challenging.
What can you do?
Homes with young children are noisy places. It is part of the fun of having 
children! But limiting background noise can make it much easier for your child 
with UHL to learn and understand what others are saying.
• Read to your child in a quiet environment and make sure their hearing ear  
 is closest to you.
• Turn off the TV/radio/music at mealtimes. Sit at the table together and  
 chat. Mealtimes provide excellent opportunities for language   
 development.
• Vacuum cleaners, washing machines and lawnmowers all make it very  
 difficult for your child to understand what you are saying to them. Be 
 aware of this if you give them instructions or warn them about something.
Families spend a lot of time in the car, and this can also be a difficult listening 
environment for children with UHL.
• Turn off the radio and wind up the windows if you are talking in the car, or  
 listening to music or a book. 
• Your child with UHL should be sitting with their affected ear alongside the  
 window for easier listening.
10 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Reverberation
Reverberation is the persistence of sound in a room after the original sound has 
stopped—like an echo. A room with ‘good acoustics’ is designed to reduce 
reverberation and make it easier to understand speech. Reverberation time 
depends mainly on the size of a room or space and the surface materials used. 
An empty bedroom with wooden floors has a longer reverberation time than a 
room with carpet, furniture and curtains.
What can you do at home?
Reverberation is usually more of a problem for children in the classroom than at 
home.
However, contemporary homes with open-plan living, timber floors and blinds 
on the windows are not easy listening environments for anyone with hearing loss. 
Soft furnishings that absorb sound reduce reverberation and make listening and 
understanding easier at home.
Carpets are better than hard floors, and curtains are better than bare windows or 
blinds.
Small things can make a difference in improving the 
listening environment for your child at home. Reducing 
noise and reverberation will help your child to listen and 
understand speech and participate fully in your family’s life. 
Sound Waves | 11LISTENING FATIGUE
Children with hearing loss exert more listening effort than their hearing peers 
when processing speech. Lip reading, interpreting expressions and filling in the 
gaps in conversations involve active concentration, often for extended periods, 
and this can cause significant fatigue. Children with UHL become more fatigued 
than normal hearing children, even when the affected ear is aided2. Fatigue can 
affect your child’s classroom performance, capacity to learn effectively, social 
relationships and their quality of life. 
Children with hearing loss have described feeling tired, drained, or exhausted 
after periods of concentrated listening. Increased listening effort can lead to 
cognitive fatigue, where the child is likely to have difficulty concentrating, 
become distractible and be less attentive. Cognitive fatigue, in turn, can lead to 
feelings of stress, tension and emotional difficulties.
The experience of listening-related fatigue in children with hearing loss varies 
widely. The amount of fatigue doesn’t directly correlate with the degree or type 
of hearing loss. There are currently no specific tests for measuring listening 
fatigue in children with hearing loss. Nevertheless, it’s important to recognise 
that children with hearing loss have an increased risk of fatigue at school. 
There are strategies for managing listening-related fatigue that can be 
implemented in the school setting.

12 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024SOUND LOCALISATION AND SAFETY
One of the difficulties people with unilateral hearing loss have is recognising 
where a sound is coming from. We need sound to reach both our ears to localise 
the sound. Our brain receives the sound signal from both ears and can accurately 
interpret where a sound is coming from.
With unilateral hearing loss, your child’s brain may only receive the signal from 
the better ear, and while your child will hear the sound, they won’t be able to tell 
where it is coming from. The greater the degree of hearing loss, the more difficult 
localising sound will become.
The most noticeable difficulty for families is when calling their children. Tell them 
exactly where you are, or they will struggle to find you.
Road safety
An inability to localise sound has a more critical impact - safety, particularly on 
the road. Your child may hear a car but not know its direction. Good road safety 
behaviour starts early. Children learn from watching their parents, and they copy 
their behaviour. Set a good example from the start:
• Cross the road at traffic lights or pedestrian crossings.
• Don’t cross the road between parked cars. Children cannot see an 
approaching vehicle, and the child with unilateral hearing loss may not hear 
the car or know which side the car is coming from.
• Car parks can also be hazardous for the same reason.
Generally, children under 10 need active adult supervision when crossing the 
road. They have difficulty judging how far away a car is and how fast it is going. 
Children also find it hard to identify if a place is safe to cross the road. Learning 
to cross the road safely takes time and practice. Walking with your child to the 
shops or school is an ideal time to teach road safety behaviour.
Sound Waves | 13
Stop - Look - Listen - Think
Teach you child to STOP – LOOK – LISTEN – THINK  when crossing the road. 
Model the process when you are crossing the road with your child.
STOP:  ‘Is this a good/safe place to cross?’
LOOK: ‘Is the car coming towards you or driving away? ‘Is the car going fast or 
slow? Can the driver see you?’
LISTEN:  ‘Can you hear any traffic? Remember you need to look and see where 
it is coming from!’
THINK: ‘ Is the road safe in both 
directions?’ ‘Do you think it’s safe to 
cross now?’
Bicycle safety
All children need to be taught cycling safety. Start teaching them good riding 
habits when they get their first bike. Children with UHL may experience two 
additional challenges when riding their bike:
• When riding on the pavement, children may not hear when a car is pulling  
 out of a driveway, and the driver may not be able to see them. They need  
 to learn to be cautious at each driveway.
• When riding on a bike track, they may not hear another bike coming from  
 behind or be able to decide which side to move when the rider rings their  
 bell. Rear vision mirrors or learning to ride on the left side of the path so  
 that other bikes can overtake may avoid a few unnecessary mishaps.
Talking to your child about their hearing loss and the extra 
precautions they must take will help them understand their 
responsibilities and keep them safe.
14 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024ADVOCATING FOR YOUR CHILD
Parents naturally want the best for their children and are uniquely positioned to 
understand their needs and speak up on their behalf. As parents of a child with 
UHL, you may need to become advocates—speaking up for your child to 
negotiate for services and support. Many parents find themselves becoming 
advocates when their child starts school, but there are numerous situations 
before school where advocacy skills can be beneficial, such as finding an early 
intervention service and starting child care or preschool.
Being an advocate for your child requires preparation and a well-informed 
approach. Here are some steps you can take to become an effective advocate:
Build relationships with professionals: Maintain a good working 
relationship with the professionals involved in your child's care. Ask questions, 
ensure you understand their responses, and don't hesitate to reach out to them. 
Educate yourself: Become informed about UHL, its potential effects, and 
outcomes for children with UHL. Know your child’s rights regarding services and 
support, and stay updated on research and any new or discontinued services 
for children with UHL.
Understand the system: Learn the rules, terminology, and jargon 
related to education and support services. This is particularly helpful when 
developing plans for the NDIS or advocating for support at school.
Keep records: Maintain thorough records, including reports from 
professionals and notes from phone calls or meetings. You can send follow-up 
letters or emails to clarify what was said and agreed upon.
State your case: Practice stating your case clearly, calmly, and 
confidently. Rehearse what you want to say beforehand to ensure you 
communicate effectively.
Sound Waves | 15
Teaching  your child self-advocacy skills
Your child can benefit from learning self-advocacy skills from an early age, as you 
won't always be there to speak up for them. There are a few things you can 
implement to help your child become an effective self-advocate:
Encourage independence:  Create opportunities for your child to be 
independent and advocate for themselves. Let them order for themselves in a 
café, ask a sales assistant for help, or share a concern with their teacher.
Provide the right vocabulary: Give your child the vocabulary and 
understanding of their hearing loss to explain their needs to others.
Promote problem-solving: Resist the urge to always jump in and solve 
problems for them. Allow your child to take the lead and lean on you only when 
necessary.
Practice communication:  Help your child practice ways of 
communicating their needs in an open and respectful manner.
The power of humour: Your child will likely face some awkward or 
challenging moments, and finding the funny side of some situations can help 
ease any tension and often earn the respect of those involved.
Mentorship: Introduce your child to someone older with UHL. Sharing 
experiences with a mentor can provide confidence and guidance for young 
people learning to negotiate their needs at school and in the wider world.
By advocating for your child and teaching them self-advocacy skills, you equip 
them with the confidence and tools to navigate challenges and express their 
needs effectively. These skills foster independence and resilience that will serve 
your child well throughout their life.
16 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024STARTING DAYCARE OR PRESCHOOL
Starting daycare or preschool for a child can feel like a big step, but with the right 
approach, you can find a service that suits your child and your family. 
Choosing the right service
Children with disabilities can enrol in any early childhood education or childcare 
service in Australia. When choosing a service, it’s important to communicate your 
child's needs and abilities early on to find the best match.
Key points to consider include your child's needs and interests, the staff's 
confidence and comfort in caring for your child, and whether there are other 
children with additional needs at the service. Talking to other parents, especially 
those with children with hearing loss, can provide valuable insights into the 
services you are exploring.
Setting your expectations
Before visiting any childcare centres, it’s a good idea to consider what you're 
looking for. Are you wanting a place where your child can socialise and receive 
supervision, or do you prefer a more specialised educational environment? Do 
you want the staff to have training in special needs, or are you comfortable 
providing guidance about your child's needs? Will a general childcare program 
suffice, or do you want something more specialised? Having clear expectations 
will make it easier to communicate your needs and narrow down your options.
When communicating with childcare providers, it's important to share 
information about your child's needs. Start by providing general information 
about your child's abilities and see how the provider responds. Don't hold back 
important details, as this could impact the level of care your child receives. Once 
you have narrowed down your choices, share more specific details about your 
child, such as their medical and physical needs, behavioural challenges, ways to 
comfort or calm them, and activities they enjoy or find challenging. Providing 
these details will help create a supportive environment for your child.
Sound Waves | 17Settling in
Selecting a childcare provider is the first step in establishing a long and positive 
relationship. Expect a period of adjustment as you and your child get used to the 
new routine. It's normal to encounter some challenges along the way, but stay 
positive and work through them. Observe how your child is adapting, and 
communicate any concerns with the childcare worker or supervisor. If you feel 
that the provider is not meeting your child's needs, address the issue early or 
consider other options. 
Every child adjusts differently, so give your child the time and space they need 
to settle in. Maintain open communication between you and the provider to 
maintain a nurturing environment where your child can thrive.

18 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024STARTING SCHOOL
Starting school is an exciting time in any child's life, but it can also be a source of 
stress for families with a child who has unilateral hearing loss. Questions run 
through your head, such as:
‘Is my child ready to start school?’
‘Which school will best suit my child's needs?’ 
‘Will the school provide the right listening environment 
for my child?’
A school will appreciate knowing well in advance (at least six or nine months 
before school starts) that your child will be attending their school. Early 
communication with the school allows them ample time to prepare for your 
child's arrival.
Is my child ready to start school?
School readiness depends on several factors, including your child's age and 
maturity level. Listen to the advice of preschool teachers and health professionals 
while also considering what you know about your child. 
Providing a stimulating learning environment at home will set the foundations for 
a successful transition to school. Here are some ways to do this:
• Read a range of books with your child, including fiction, non-fiction,  
 nursery rhymes, and poetry.
• Visit interesting places and expose your child to a broad range of   
 experiences. Discuss what they saw and learnt with them afterwards.
• Encourage social interactions with family and friends and nurture early  
 friendships.
• Give your child the vocabulary and understanding of their hearing loss to  
 explain their needs to others.
• Empower your child to advocate for themselves; they must do this   
 independently at school.
• Build their self-advocacy confidence in small, supportive settings so they  
 feel comfortable addressing their listening needs in the school   
 environment.
Sound Waves | 19Which school will best suit my child's 
needs?
Start your research and preparation early. Most children with UHL will attend 
mainstream schools and may receive few considerations. Therefore, ensuring the 
school understands your child's needs and can provide the necessary support for 
full access to the curriculum is crucial.
Visiting schools in your area is a good idea. Attend open days with your child to 
gauge their feelings about each school. Talking to other parents and students 
can provide valuable insights into the school community. Finally, arrange a 
meeting with the principal to discuss your child’s needs and ask any questions.
Will the school provide the right listening 
environment for my child?
Children with UHL need to concentrate harder to understand what is said in noisy 
environments. This can make them tired, which makes learning more difficult. A 
good listening environment at school makes a significant difference to children 
with UHL. Consider these questions when selecting a school:
• Are there other children with hearing loss at the school? If so, the staff may  
 have a better understanding of your child's needs, and a visiting teacher of 
 the deaf might be available to offer advice.
• How large are the classes? Larger classes are noisier, making it harder for  
 your child to hear.
• Where is the school located? Schools on main roads may be noisier,  
 making listening more challenging.
• Is the classroom design suitable? Avoid demountable and open-plan  
 classrooms, as these often have higher noise levels, making it harder to  
 understand what is being said in the classroom.
• Have the classrooms been acoustically treated? Look for classrooms with  
 carpeted floors, and acoustic tiles on the ceiling, as these features   
 improve the listening environment.
• What opportunities exist for parent involvement? As a parent of a child  
 with UHL, you should build solid relationships with the school staff. Good  
 communication and a willingness to be involved will foster a successful  
 partnership with the school.
20 | © Aussie Deaf Kids 2024Have I made the right decision?
Families choose schools for many reasons, such as religious affiliations, family 
traditions, or the desire to send all their children to the same school. It may take 
some time to determine if you've made the right choice for your child with UHL. 
Flexibility is helpful, as what works for one child may not work for another. If you 
feel a different school environment might be better for your child's learning 
needs, exploring other options is worth considering. 
As children mature, it’s crucial to include them in any decision-making process 
about their schooling. Their input can provide valuable insights into their comfort 
levels, preferences, and any specific challenges they may face. By involving 
them, you empower your child, helping them feel more in control and confident 
about their school years.

Classroom tips | Aussie Deaf Kids,"Skip to content Classroom tips You are here: Home » Resources » Education » Information for your child’s teacher » Classroom tips Explore this section When addressing the pupil say his/her name first and identify the topic you are covering. Seat the pupil for optimal listening and visual cues within the classroom. Ideally, this should be with the pupil’s back to the window, seated one third of the distance of the room from the teacher, not in the front row directly beneath the teacher. Beware of possible misunderstanding – avoid idioms, sarcasm, slang (if you use them, explain). Sometimes ask other pupils if they have heard or understood rather than always focusing on the child with hearing loss. Speak in an ordinary tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements, and at a normal rate of speaking. Make sure your lips are clearly visible. Face the class, not the blackboard, when speaking. Make sure the room does not have bright lights shining directly in the child’s face. Back-lighting is ideal. Be aware that the pupil is unlikely to be able to lip read or fully hear during a film/slide presentation. Either use a captioned film or provide information (transcript) in advance. Institute a buddy system – such as a classroom helper or official note-taker. Provide an opportunity for the pupil to share information with the class about the hearing aid and/or FM system and how it works. Request in-service instruction to learn how to check your puil’s hearing aids; keep extra batteries on hand. Be aware that every child is an individual with his/her own strengths and limitations. Thus it is important not to have a preconceived notion of function based on the degree of hearing loss. Remember always to speak naturally and clearly. If using exaggerated mouth movements, extremely fast or slow rates of speaking or overly loud speech, the pupil may have difficulty understanding. Make sure always to make lip reading possible. Thus be careful not to chew gum or eat while talking to the pupils. Remember always to make a recognisable transition when moving on to a new subject. Consider passing around a written copy of the day’s and week’s assignments for all pupils, or writing assignments on the board. back to top Information provided by Oticon .

How listener friendly is your classroom? | Aussie Deaf Kids,"Skip to content How listener friendly is your classroom? You are here: Home » Resources » Education » Information for your child’s teacher » How listener friendly is your classroom? Explore this section A good listening environment is crucial to successful classroom learning. Many factors affect the listening environment. Classrooms are typically noisy and reverberant, making listening difficult for pupils with normal hearing as well as those with hearing loss. Check your classroom, using the following questions. If you discover that you have a poor listening environment (when no is answered to the following questions), follow the provided tips. Classroom checklist and useful tips 1. Noise outside the classroom Yes No Is your classroom in a quiet area away from external noise sources (traffic, construction, playground, busy hallways, shops, etc.)? Tip: Reduce external noise as much as possible by evaluating your classroom location. For a pupil with a hearing loss, choose a classroom located away from traffic and noisy areas. Avoid areas where groups of children congregate. Even simple things like shrubbery just outside the classroom windows can help reduce external noise. 2. Noise inside the classroom Yes No Do you have a quiet classroom without noise sources, such as fans, heating and cooling systems, etc.? Is the floor carpeted? Do the windows have curtains? Do chairs, desks and tables have rubber stops to cut down on noise? Tip: Evaluate and monitor internal classroom noises on an ongoing basis. Air conditioners, heating systems, computers, projectors and light fixtures can all contribute to internal background noise, making hearing difficult. Most of us simply “tune out” these sounds unconsciously. But for a child with hearing instruments it is not always that easy. Have equipment serviced regularly to eliminate noise created by malfunction. And look for areas where adjustments can be made to improve classroom acoustics: Acoustically-treated low ceilings Carpeting (floors, and even parts of walls) Well-fitting doors Thick curtains; acoustic panelling Use of absorptive materials on hard reflective surfaces (cork bulletin boards etc.) Windows and doors closed during instruction . 3. Listening skills Yes No Do you evaluate listening skills and provide programs to strengthen these skills? Do you make listening fun? Tip: Listening skills can be evaluated in many ways and they can fun. Contact the appropriate staff person in your school regarding the availability of pupil observation forms. Use game-like activities that make your pupils want to listen. 4. Teacher’s voice Yes No Are you projecting your voice so that you can be heard in the back of the room? Tip: Check with pupils periodically to be certain that they can hear you well. Speak clearly, but do not yell. Even though a child may be wearing hearing aids, normal hearing cannot be achieved. Seating hard-of-hearing pupils near the front of the class should be strongly considered, unless FM assistive listening equipment 1 is being used. 5. Teacher’s language Yes No When you speak, do you use clear, concise language? Tip: Use age appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. If new words are introduced, explain them. Avoid excessive use of irony, figurative language and idioms. A child with a hearing loss is often concentrating on the literal translation. If the message is too complicated, pupils won’t listen or learn. 6. Communication Yes No Do you ensure that the pupils understand directions, both oral and written? Do you use visual aids (video, overheads, etc.)? Tip: Question pupils regularly regarding their understanding of written and oral directions. Do not assume that these are understood. Ask the pupil to repeat your instructions, rather than simply asking him/her if he/she heard you. Take care not to focus or single out the pupil with the hearing loss too much. 7. Hearing tactics Yes No Is there sufficient light in the room to aid oral communication with lip reading? Do you try to talk face-to-face with your pupils? Tip: A pupil with any type of hearing loss should face away from windows to avoid light shining in his/her face. The face of the speaker should be in good light. Speaking face-to-face enables the listener to utilise visual cues such as lip reading and facial expressions. Speak in a normal tone of voice, without exaggerated lip movements. You should also model good listening habits by really listening to what your pupils are saying and showing interest. Schedule specific times for sharing information and give your full attention. back to top Footnote: FM assistive listening equipment is now commonly called Remote Microphone Systems Additional reading Listening fatigue at school Information provided by Oticon .

A quick guide to communication | Aussie Deaf Kids,"Skip to content A quick guide to communication You are here: Home » Resources » Language and communication » Getting started » A quick guide to communication Explore this section As your child grows, it will be important to use good communication with them, and with the deaf adults you meet. The following tips for good communication can be used with deaf children, young people and adults who use either speech or sign language (such as Auslan) and with those children who use a combination of both speech and signing. Make sure that you have your child’s attention before starting a conversation. Make sure you are facing your child and maintaining good eye contact. Try to be on the same level as them and allow some space for signing or lip-reading. (So, keep a distance of about one to two metres between you and your child). Use a well-lit room and don’t have your back to a window, as this creates a shadow and makes it difficult to read facial expressions or lip-read. Speak clearly, naturally and at a normal pace. Don’t shout, as it can appear to your child that you are angry and it also distorts lip patterns. Try to make sure that background noise is kept to a minimum. Children with hearing aids, cochlear implants or those children with mild or unilateral deafness who do not use hearing aids may find it particularly difficult to pick out what is being said. A room that is carpeted or curtained will help to cut down the effects of noise in a room. If your child does not use sign language, it is still helpful to use your hands and facial expressions to gesture and support what you are saying. Don’t eat, smoke, or block the view of your face while you are speaking. If you have a beard or moustache, keep it trimmed. Also remember that glasses and sunglasses can make it difficult to maintain eye contact. When in a group, speak one at a time. It is helpful if the speaker raises their hand before talking so that your child knows who is speaking. Make sure you let your child know when there is a new topic of conversation. If a word or sign is not easily understood, use a more common word or sign with the same meaning. Be wary of using unusual words. Pause between sentences and check that your child has understood you, and that you have understood them.  Encourage them to stop you if they don’t understand what the conversation is about.

"NDIS providers: quality, respect & safety | Raising Children Network","15 Found this helpful Key points NDIS providers should offer good-quality, respectful and safe services and supports. There are rules about quality, respect and safety. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission makes sure NDIS providers know and follow the rules. If you’re unhappy with the service your child is getting from an NDIS provider, it’s OK to say so. NDIS providers: what you can expect from services and support Your child’s NDIS providers should give your child and your family supports and services that are: good quality respectful safe. The NDIS has a Code of Conduct with rules about how NDIS providers should treat NDIS participants like your child. These rules ensure that NDIS providers offer good-quality, respectful and safe services and supports. Good-quality NDIS services and supports Here are things NDIS providers should do to ensure that your child gets good-quality services and supports: Supply only services that they’re qualified and trained to supply – for example, your child’s speech therapist should focus only on communication, eating, swallowing and so on. Act on any concerns about quality and safety – for example, your child’s NDIS provider might reduce background noise or music if it’s too stimulating for your child. Be honest, clear and realistic with you – for example, your child’s NDIS provider should explain how a therapy will help your child work towards their NDIS goals. Be transparent about their services – for example, your child’s NDIS provider should tell you about their fees and any additional costs you can expect, like fees for writing reports. Respectful NDIS services and supports Here are things NDIS providers should do to ensure that your child gets respectful services and supports: Involve your child in decisions when possible – for example, a younger child might be able to choose the colour of their eating aid, and an older child might be able to choose between therapists. Give information that you, your child and your child’s other carers can understand – for example, NDIS providers might organise an interpreter to explain a therapy in your family’s language. Respect your child’s background, beliefs, gender and sexuality – for example, your child’s therapist should offer to remove their shoes before entering your home if that’s polite in your culture. Keep information about your child and family private – for example, NDIS providers must store information in accordance with privacy laws and share it with other providers only when you say they can. Respect your child’s privacy by keeping conversations focused on your child’s therapy goals – for example, if your child has 2 mothers, your child’s therapist shouldn’t ask questions about how your child was conceived. Being respectful is about making sure that providers use language and offer information that relates to the experiences of all families, including LGBTIQ+ families , single-parent families , blended families and so on. For example, posters and handouts could include images of families with 2 mums and 2 dads or families from diverse cultural backgrounds. Safe NDIS services and supports Here are things NDIS providers should do to ensure that your child gets safe services and supports: Provide a physically safe space – for example, your child should be able to move around with their walker without bumping into things. Provide a verbally safe space – for example, people should speak to you and your child in kind and gentle ways. Provide an emotionally safe space – for example, you should feel comfortable to share information about your cultural background, any trauma your child or you have experienced, or your experiences parenting a gender-diverse child or being part of a LGBTQ+ family. Safety is also about protecting your child from harm , including physical violence, verbal aggression, sexual abuse, insults, humiliation and neglect. The law says that NDIS providers must take all reasonable steps to prevent these forms of harm from affecting your child. Ensuring quality, respect and safety: NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission All NDIS providers are regulated by an Australian Government agency called the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission. The NDIS Commission makes sure NDIS providers and their workers follow the rules and requirements that are outlined in the NDIS Code of Conduct. To do this, the NDIS Commission: makes sure NDIS providers know and follow rules about quality, respect and safety helps with and responds to complaints, concerns and serious incidents related to NDIS providers and their workers keeps a list of registered NDIS providers, who have to do extra things to ensure the quality and safety of their services and supports. The NDIS Commission can take action against registered or unregistered NDIS providers or workers who aren’t treating people the way that the NDIS Code of Conduct says they should. For example, the NDIS Commission can ban providers from working with NDIS participants. The NDIS Commission can also take action against registered NDIS providers who aren’t following the NDIS Practice Standards . If your child or you are unhappy with the way an NDIS provider is treating you or the quality of their services, it’s always OK to speak up. It’s best to raise your concern with the NDIS provider first. You can also make a complaint to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission .

NDIS: reasonable and necessary supports | Raising Children Network,"24 Found this helpful Key points The NDIS funds reasonable and necessary supports for children with disability or developmental delay. Supports must meet certain guidelines to be considered reasonable and necessary. Reasonable and necessary supports help children work towards their goals in life. This page is under review because the NDIS is making changes. After 3 October 2024, there will be a clear list of what you can spend your child’s NDIS funds on. And your child’s NDIS plan will have a total budget amount, which shows you how much money there is and how long it needs to last. For more information about these and other changes, go to NDIS – Changes to NDIS legislation . Reasonable and necessary supports: what are they? The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) funds reasonable and necessary supports for children with disability or developmental delay and adults with disability. To be considered reasonable and necessary , a support must be: related to your child’s disability or developmental delay value for money likely to work and benefit your child based on evidence. Reasonable and necessary supports don’t include day-to-day living costs that aren’t related to your child’s disability support needs. Reasonable and necessary supports take into account any informal, community or mainstream supports that your child already has. These might include things like help and support your child and family get from: friends and extended family local and community services health and education systems. What do reasonable and necessary supports do? Reasonable and necessary supports help children and their families work towards children’s individual goals in life. All the supports that are funded by the NDIS and included in your child’s NDIS plan must be related to your child’s NDIS goals . In general, reasonable and necessary supports should help children to: become more independent take part in social and community activities look after their health and wellbeing. How does the NDIA decide what’s reasonable and necessary? The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) runs the NDIS. When the NDIA makes decisions about what supports are reasonable and necessary for your child, it uses the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 , National Disability Insurance Scheme Rules 2013 and the NDIS Operational Guidelines .

Disability supports not funded by the NDIS | Raising Children Network,"217 Found this helpful Key points Children with disability, autism or other additional needs might be able to get support from the NDIS and other sources. The NDIS doesn’t fund support that children can get from family, friends and other community and government services. This support includes Centrelink payments and community, education, employment, family and health services. Applying for support can be complex. It helps to get organised. Support for children with disability: what’s funded by the NDIS and what’s not If you have a child with disability, an autistic child, or a child with other additional needs , you and your family might be able to get various types of support. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is Australia’s national disability support system. If your child is eligible for the NDIS, it: does fund supports that are reasonable and necessary and that will help your child work towards their goals does not fund supports that your child can get from other community and government services, day-to-day living costs that aren’t related to your child’s disability support needs, or informal supports from family and friends. This guide outlines services and supports that fall outside the scope of the NDIS. Children with disability, autistic children and children with other additional needs can get these services and support, even if they’re not eligible for the NDIS. The NDIS can help children with disability, autistic children and children with other additional needs find services and supports in their communities. Call the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) on 1800 800 100 for more information, or speak to your early childhood partner or local area coordinator if you have one. The Carer Gateway , a disability association or an advocacy organisation could also help. Getting non-NDIS funded support for children with disability You have to apply for support for your child with disability, autistic child or child with other additional needs. For some types of support, you need to supply proof of your child’s diagnosis, if they have one. For other types, you’ll have to explain why you or your child needs extra help. Sometimes you might be put on a waiting list for funding. There are different types of support. They include support that is: paid directly to you, either as income support or as medical or health rebates allocated to your child and paid directly to a service provider paid to a service provider without being specifically allocated to you or your child – for example, disability employment services offered as concession rates on certain goods and services. Applying for support can be a complex process, so it’s important to get organised. It helps to be prepared to spend time talking on the phone, filling in forms and making appointments. It’s also a good idea to keep records of your conversations with service providers and make notes about what you spend on support for your child. Centrelink payments and other supports Carer Allowance (means-tested) Carer Allowance is a means-tested payment for people who care for children with disability or medical conditions at home. The payment starts from the date you put the form in, not the date your child is diagnosed, so it’s a good idea to apply as soon as possible. Carer Allowance is a fortnightly payment. The Government also announces extra one-off payments from time to time. Once your child is over 16, you’ll need to reapply. Carer Payment (means-tested) Carer Payment is a means-tested payment for people who can’t support themselves because they’re providing constant care for children with disability or medical conditions. It’s a fortnightly payment. The Government also announces extra one-off payments from time to time. Once your child is over 16, you’ll need to reapply. Disability Support Pension Children over 16 years old might be eligible for a Disability Support Pension . This might affect your Carer Payment. Health Care Card Your child gets a Health Care Card automatically when you get the Carer Allowance. It means your child pays less for prescription medicines and gets other concessions like bulk billing by some doctors and higher refunds through Medicare Safety Nets. Community services and supports The following people and places can give you support in your local community or help you find local supports and services: child and family health centres GPs or other health professionals local councils local libraries MyTime groups Neighbourhood Houses other parents. Disability assessment services and supports Hearing Services Program The Hearing Services Program provides hearing assessments and a standard range of devices. Children who are eligible will get hearing devices through this program. Other children might be able to get hearing devices through their NDIS plan. Public disability and autism assessment services You won’t have to pay for these assessment services. Contact your state or territory disability or autism association, a health professional (like your child’s GP or paediatrician ), or the NDIS for details of services in your area and information about the process in your state or territory. Some of these services might have long waiting lists. You can get information about these and other services from local and state government disability services , state autism associations , disability-specific organisations and health professionals. Education services and supports Australian Government Department of Education Inclusion Support Program The Inclusion Support Program funds approved child care services, including out of school hours and holiday programs, to include all children in their programs, including children with high support needs. Your child care service will need to apply through its state or territory Inclusion Agency. You can discuss your child’s needs with the child care service. Preschool Inclusion Support Your child’s preschool or kindergarten can apply for Inclusion Support from your state or territory government to fund extra resources to help the preschool or kindergarten include all children in its programs. Ask your preschool or kindergarten director about inclusion support. Government, independent and Catholic schools all have support and funding for children with disability at school . Your child’s school can explain what’s available. You can also contact the disability and education agencies or departments in your state or territory for more information. Employment services and supports Disability Employment Services Disability Employment Services help people with disability find work and keep jobs. They can help your child with things like writing a resumé or practising for job interviews. Job Capacity Assessment Your child might need a Job Capacity Assessment to check whether they’re eligible for the Disability Support Pension. An assessment can also help you understand what help your child might need to find a job. There are many agencies and organisations that specialise in helping people with additional needs prepare for and find work. Get links and contacts for these services in our guide to employment services for young people with additional needs .

Unregistered & registered NDIS providers | Raising Children Network,"18 Found this helpful Key points NDIS providers supply services and supports to people in the National Disability Insurance Scheme. NDIS providers can be registered or unregistered. This affects who can use them. NDIS rules and requirements ensure safety and quality in the services and supports supplied by NDIS providers. About NDIS providers NDIS providers are organisations and people that supply supports and services to NDIS participants like your child. NDIS providers can be companies, charities or not-for-profit organisations. They can also be individuals. Registered NDIS providers and unregistered NDIS providers: what’s the difference? Registered NDIS providers are registered with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, a government agency that regulates all NDIS providers. Unregistered providers aren’t registered with the NDIS Commission. The key thing about NDIS providers being registered or unregistered with the NDIS Commission is that it affects who can use them. And this depends on how you manage your child’s NDIS funds : If you self-manage or plan-manage your child’s NDIS funds , you can use registered NDIS providers, unregistered NDIS providers or a mix of both. If the NDIA manages your child’s funds , you can use only registered NDIS providers. Some but not all NDIS providers must register with the NDIS Commission. But being registered or unregistered shouldn’t affect the level of support or quality of service that your child gets from providers. If your child is an NDIS participant, you can search for registered NDIS providers in the Provider Finder on the myplace portal . You can also go to the NDIS website to find registered NDIS providers in your state and territory . Registered and unregistered NDIS providers: NDIS rules and requirements Both registered and unregistered providers must : treat people according to rules in the NDIS Code of Conduct respond appropriately to complaints from people using their services. The NDIS has extra quality and safety requirements for registered providers . They must: comply with NDIS Practice Standards employ, check and train their workers according to NDIS Commission standards ensure workers have the qualifications required for their profession – for example, registration with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) ensure workers have a working with children (WWC) check report incidents to the NDIS Commission – for example, serious injury or abuse. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission and NDIS providers The NDIS Commission makes sure all NDIS providers work according to NDIS rules and requirements. To do this, the NDIS Commission: makes sure NDIS providers know and follow the rules for quality and safety assists with and responds to concerns, complaints and serious incidents related to all NDIS providers. The NDIS Commission can take action against registered or unregistered NDIS providers or workers who aren’t treating people the way that the NDIS Code of Conduct says they should. For example, the NDIS Commission can ban NDIS providers from working with NDIS participants. The NDIS Commission can also take action against registered NDIS providers who aren’t following the NDIS Practice Standards. Your child is entitled to good-quality, respectful and safe supports and services . If you or your child feel unsafe with your child’s registered or unregistered NDIS providers, or if you’re unhappy with their services, it’s always OK to say so. You can start by raising your concern with your child’s NDIS provider or you can make a complaint to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission .
